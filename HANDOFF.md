# PLANK AVP Relay and Setup app

## Current state — 0.6.8 / build 40 released October 7, 2026

The operator approved integration of upstream PR #4, removal of the retired
TabletSetup build identity, and a coordinated app/relay build and release.
PR #3 is merged at `942b82b`; PR #4 is merged at `ac6c7de`. The latter preserves
the tested complete-package source and pins raw drawing commit
`029721f9b60833d36aa31f4da558cf8325e111ca`. The separate PLANK Vision Client
requirement is build 46 / publication `5f2d28a10a0a1a113b7618bcf4e7b1e521f00725`.

Version 0.6.8 keeps only `la.instinctual.PLANK.AVPrelay`, preserves its existing
pairing storage, and retains the public DrawingRegistration group needed for
Allow PLANK. The package includes both management and raw drawing services.
Release source `c01337380bb19131980956d0e3e373e063dc1c1b` is committed and pushed
to `main`, and tagged `v0.6.8`. Both the Setup app and Linux installers were built
from that exact source; subsequent documentation commits do not change their
provenance.

[GitHub release v0.6.8](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/releases/tag/v0.6.8)
contains the regular Ubuntu Server 26.04 amd64 and Debian 13 / Armbian arm64
installers, architecture provenance, checksums and source commit. Every uploaded
asset digest matches its local file. No dbgsym package was built or published.
Local installers are only in `artifacts/deb/0.6.8/<platform>/<architecture>/`;
release metadata and native validation logs are in `artifacts/releases/0.6.8/`.

TestFlight: PLANK AVP Relay, bundle `la.instinctual.PLANK.AVPrelay`, app record
`6818323499`, version 0.6.8, build 40. Upload succeeded October 8 at 00:50:42 UTC
(October 7 locally). Apple reports VALID and IN_BETA_TESTING internally. The
notes in `apps/tablet-setup/TestFlight/0.6.8-40.txt` and the confirmed Standard /
No France compliance baseline were saved and verified. Both existing PLANK
Testing groups have build access. External distribution was submitted with
automatic notification enabled; readback is WAITING_FOR_REVIEW /
WAITING_FOR_BETA_REVIEW. External installation awaits Apple's approval. The
previous build 39 now reports BETA_REJECTED externally; its older pending-review
notes below are historical and do not establish external availability.

Validation: [native workflow 37708597656](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/actions/runs/37708597656)
passes both builds and both clean-install/upgrade/removal jobs, including retained
state checks. Each architecture passes 37 managed and 26 raw drawing suites plus
101 libsodium checks. All 27 Apple test suites, macOS and visionOS simulator/device
builds, signed archive/export, bundle and dSYM validation pass. The exported
distribution app retains the canonical private Keychain group and authorizes the
shared DrawingRegistration group; its expanded Info.plist receipt group matches.
Archive, IPA, hashes, provenance, signing/upload logs and TestFlight readback are
under `artifacts/testflight/0.6.8/build-40/`. One-time mac12 build/upload jobs were
unloaded after successful completion.

No live relay upgrade, headset installation or ownership reset was performed in
this release. Existing 0.6.7 app approvals and tablet bonds are retained on update.
The separate matching PLANK Vision Client build 46 is required for drawing; this
release neither publishes that app nor establishes its TestFlight availability.
Fully wireless Wacom plus isolated Bluetooth drawing remains a separate hardware
qualification. Previous network-isolation acceptance used a USB tablet. Preserve
that distinction in future release notes and live testing.

## Previous release — 0.6.7


Release policy: publish a GitHub release only alongside a matching TestFlight
release. Normal Linux builds must not generate or publish dbgsym packages.
The operator explicitly requested both rules after the 0.6.6 release.
Every approved TestFlight release must also be assigned to all existing external
testing groups for this app and submitted for Apple's beta review when required,
with automatic tester notification enabled. Internal availability alone is not
completion. This standing instruction was given on October 1, 2026; do not ask
for permission again on future releases. Report review-pending status separately
from external availability. Keep reviewer contact details in App Store Connect
or private deployment files, never in Git.
Commit `500f16f` implements the packaging rule. Follow-up workflow run
`36799799368` passes both native package builds and both clean-install jobs,
including the new requirement for exactly one installer per architecture.
The published 0.6.6 installers retain their original release provenance;
release notes and checksums now omit the removed debug-symbol downloads.

### Release 0.6.7 / build 39 completed — October 1, 2026

The operator requested delivery after creating the new App Store Connect
record. Matching app and relay version 0.6.7 is published, including the approved
capture-ownership and authenticated-route changes. Source commit
`7ebe1a50189c619c0af9392b81376ce18c30f261` was fast-forward merged from
`authenticated-route-discovery` into `main` and tagged `v0.6.7`; both app and
installers were built from that exact commit. The entries below describe the
earlier preparation stages; this release entry supersedes their pending status.

TestFlight: PLANK AVP Relay, bundle `la.instinctual.PLANK.AVPrelay`, app record
`6818323499`, version 0.6.7, build 39. Upload completed at 22:07:36 UTC. Apple
reports VALID and IN_BETA_TESTING. The notes in
`apps/tablet-setup/TestFlight/0.6.7-39.txt` and the previously confirmed
Standard / No France compliance baseline were saved and read back successfully.
The new internal PLANK Testing group has automatic distribution enabled and
contains only the operator; its build access and INVITED state were verified.
The previous app's internal tester ID could not be assigned directly: creating
the membership with the same account email and new group produced a distinct
tester resource for this app. No external testers or public links were added.
Private API configuration continues to target this new app; the old app record
and its configuration backup remain intact.

[GitHub release v0.6.7](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/releases/tag/v0.6.7)
contains the regular Ubuntu Server 26.04 amd64 and Debian 13 / Armbian arm64
installers, architecture provenance, checksums and source commit. No dbgsym was
built or published. Local installers are only in
`artifacts/deb/0.6.7/<platform>/<architecture>/`; release metadata is in
`artifacts/releases/0.6.7/` without duplicate installers.

Validation: all 33 Linux suites pass on each architecture. Native workflow
[36932402141](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/actions/runs/36932402141)
passes both package builds, installed-package checks, and clean-install/upgrade/
removal jobs. All 22 Apple suites, macOS and visionOS simulator/device builds,
signed archive/export, bundle and dSYM checks pass. The exported distribution
profile matches the new app identity and team, is unexpired, and disables
development debugging. Archive, IPA, hashes, signing/upload logs, provenance and
TestFlight readback are under `artifacts/testflight/0.6.7/build-39/`. The one-time
mac12 signing/upload LaunchAgents were unloaded.

No live relay upgrade, AVP development install or headset-ownership reset was
performed during publication; the subsequent host upgrade is recorded below.
The new app installs separately and needs fresh authorization. When ready to
switch, run `sudo plank-avp-relay-admin reset-headsets --yes` through SSH, then
complete setup in the new app; tablet Bluetooth bonds remain. Physical wireless
latency, capture handover and route recovery still need live validation.

### Relay-02 upgraded; TestFlight distribution status — October 1, 2026

At the operator's request, upgraded `plank-avp-relay-02` from 0.6.6 to the
published 0.6.7 arm64 package. This host runs Armbian Debian 13 userspace with
kernel `6.18.54-current-rockchip64`. Verified the installer checksum before
installation. A private state/configuration backup remains on the host at
`/var/backups/plank-avp-relay/upgrade-0.6.7-20261001/`; its contents stay outside
the repository. Relay identity, headset approvals, tablet selection and relay
configuration were compared before/after and retained. No ownership reset was
performed.

Configuration validation passes. The relay, Bluetooth, Avahi, Wi-Fi and USB
services are active with no restarts observed after installation. Startup logs
confirm TCP 28991 listeners, network discovery registration, Bluetooth L2CAP
PSM 128 and advertising, with the existing 15 ms connection preference.
Deployment evidence is in `artifacts/deployments/0.6.7/relay02-20261001/`.
Temporary upgrade files and the one-time systemd upgrade unit were cleaned up.
No physical tablet/headset test was performed as part of this installation.

The operator asked why External Testing shows no builds. API readback confirms
build 39 is IN_BETA_TESTING in the internal PLANK Testing group; the operator's
internal tester state is now INSTALLED. A separate external PLANK Testing group
exists with one tester and no builds. Build 39 is READY_FOR_BETA_SUBMISSION
externally; no external review submission or distribution was performed.

The operator then instructed that every future TestFlight release must also be
submitted to external groups and supplied the review contact details. Those
details and the feedback email were saved in App Store Connect and a private
`tablet-setup-review-contact.json` beside the existing API configuration; do not
copy them into Git. Version 0.6.7 / build 39 is now assigned to the external
PLANK Testing group, with automatic notification enabled, and submitted for
beta review. Readback reports WAITING_FOR_REVIEW / WAITING_FOR_BETA_REVIEW;
external installation awaits Apple's approval. Evidence is in
`artifacts/testflight/0.6.7/build-39/external-verification.json`.

`scripts/update-tablet-testflight.py` now performs this external step by default
after notes/compliance verification. It uses only the exact selected app/build
and that app's existing external groups, validates review prerequisites, reuses
pending submissions, and reports pending review separately from availability.
`--inspect` remains read-only. Group members and public links are preserved.
All 14 offline metadata/distribution tests pass, including multiple groups,
retries, missing contact, rejected reviews and failed write verification.
Reusable beta description/reviewer instructions are under
`apps/tablet-setup/TestFlight/`; contact details remain private. This automation
change does not change the app binary or the installed relay package.

PR #1 was closed at the operator's request after verifying its head remained
`5a915a7`; its approved work was integrated separately and released in 0.6.7.
GitHub correctly shows closed rather than directly merged.

### AVP app bundle identity — October 1, 2026

The operator approved the exact bundle ID `la.instinctual.PLANK.AVPrelay`.
The Xcode target, Info.plist template, bundle/development validators, Bluetooth
and network log subsystems, and Keychain service now use that identity. The
Keychain service is `la.instinctual.PLANK.AVPrelay.pairing.v1`; no old-identity
migration or shared-access entitlement was added. Display name remains
PLANK AVP Relay Setup. The new identity is a separate app install and will need
fresh relay authorization; reset relay headset ownership via the documented
SSH command when deploying it, retaining tablet bonds. No live ownership reset
or device deployment has been performed.

The new bundle ID is registered in the existing Apple developer account as a
UNIVERSAL identifier and verified by API readback. The private TestFlight
metadata configuration now targets the new bundle ID; its previous exact
configuration is backed up privately for the earlier TestFlight record.
The confirmed Standard / No France baseline is retained. Do not change or
delete the previous app record or registered ID, which contain release history.

All 22 Apple suites pass, and unsigned macOS, visionOS simulator and visionOS
device builds pass the updated bundle validation on mac12. No Linux changes
were needed. Source version remains 0.6.6; build 1 is only unsigned validation.
Advance the matching app/relay software version before the next distribution.

The operator created the new App Store Connect record, verified by API
readback: PLANK AVP Relay, app ID `6818323499`, bundle ID
`la.instinctual.PLANK.AVPrelay`, SKU `plank-avp-relay`, primary language en-US.
The VISION_OS platform exists in PREPARE_FOR_SUBMISSION with Apple's initial
draft version 1.0; that placeholder does not change this repository's shared
software version. The private automation configuration matches the new record.
Matching signing profiles must be generated during the next signed archive/
export. No signed delivery, TestFlight upload or GitHub release has occurred
for the new app identity.

### Route discovery integration — October 1, 2026

The operator approved the remaining route work from PR #1 after discussing
two required changes: learn authenticated addresses through existing status
requests, with no additional tablet-test startup preflight; and prevent the
larger IP list from exhausting attempts before Bluetooth fallback.

Branch `authenticated-route-discovery` starts from `main` at `d51d272` and
incorporates the route portions of cnoellert's `b37d169` and `5a915a7`. The older
PR version/changelog entries are excluded. The shared source version remains
0.6.6; these changes have not been released or installed on either live device.
Advance the matching app/relay version before the next distributable release.

Authenticated tablet status supplies up to eight literal listener addresses,
read without AF_NETLINK or added service privileges. The app learns them during
management, refresh and the existing test status request. New routes are hints,
not approval: every connection still proves the saved relay identity. Optional
unavailable hints leave status usable. General IP connections are described as
Network, since these addresses are no longer necessarily Wi-Fi addresses.

Startup retains four bounded attempts, with Bluetooth no later than the third
candidate when available. Duplicate candidates are removed; Bluetooth-only
filtering occurs before connecting. Read-only selection and echo diagnostics
also try Bluetooth before exhausting a long address list. Once samples arrive,
up to three separate recoveries start with the route that delivered readings,
each with its own bounded startup attempts. A working stream stays in place;
learning an address does not switch it mid-test. Protocol/identity/authorization
and capture-busy failures do not trigger transport fallback. Current L2CAP,
radio preferences, startup/authentication deadlines and capture ownership are
preserved.

Validation: all 33 Linux CTest suites pass; the new route reader also passes
under systemd with the installed service's RestrictAddressFamilies policy.
Authenticated address disclosure is covered over TCP and simulated L2CAP.
All 22 Apple suites pass on mac12, including new executable tablet-startup,
fallback, stream-recovery, Bluetooth-only and cancellation scenarios. macOS,
visionOS simulator and visionOS device builds pass. The Apple fixture needed
an explicit MainActor annotation under Swift 6.4; its corrected build passes.
Native package workflow
[36926700347](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/actions/runs/36926700347)
passes both builds and both clean-install jobs (Ubuntu 26.04 amd64, Debian 13
arm64), including exactly one regular installer per architecture and no dbgsym.
The verified implementation is `e25012508455e7a5dfd8026067243b211f71164f`, committed
with upstream attribution and pushed on `authenticated-route-discovery`.
Source and validation evidence are under ignored
`artifacts/validation/authenticated-route-discovery/e250125/`; hashes of all 78
Apple validation source files match the Mac build. The one-time mac12 job is
unloaded. No live radio latency or physical handover claim is made from the
synthetic checks. The integration branch is ready; `main` remains at `d51d272`.
No device deployment, TestFlight upload or GitHub release was performed.

### Capture ownership integration — October 1, 2026

The operator requested the capture-ownership portion of cnoellert's PR #1.
Integration branch `capture-ownership` starts from released main and cherry-picks the
ownership, busy-state UI, documentation, cleanup and test-isolation commits
(`4d9d03a`, `d119ffd`, `1d16b31`, `d41a925`, `38032e4`) with attribution.
The PR's generalized route hints and extra startup preflight are excluded.
L2CAP, 15 ms preferences, separate startup/authentication deadlines and the
Bluetooth-only selector remain intact. No version or release change is made.

Idle inventory no longer opens tablet input. Observation, button approval and
tablet mutations acquire the shared abstract AF_UNIX datagram ownership socket.
The Setup app reports PLANK ownership and disables competing tablet actions;
status and network management remain available. The separate drawing service
must implement the same `plank-tablet-capture-v1` contract (verified against
the upstream checkpoint); this package does not install that service.

Additional checks cover real cross-process contention and automatic cleanup,
TCP/L2CAP management while drawing owns input, observer ownership/release, and
a competing capture acquired between status and observation. Synthetic tests
use isolated ownership names; the report-only fixture uses a mock lease.
The network fixture also supports this workstation's Python 3.9 without a
runtime compatibility shim. Implementation `d59bb547686432d0ebaf2719a0a18da50a1550e4`
passes all 32 Linux CTest suites (including 31 TCP/L2CAP cases and eight lease
cases). All 21 Apple suites and macOS/visionOS simulator/device builds pass on
mac12. Workflow run
[36923376807](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/actions/runs/36923376807)
passes both native package builds and both clean-install jobs, with one regular
installer per architecture and no dbgsym. The unchanged report-order tests still
deliver the complete paced 200-report/s source over TCP and simulated L2CAP;
these are software checks, not physical radio or pen-to-display measurements.

Validation evidence and the exact source snapshot are under ignored
`artifacts/validation/capture-ownership/d59bb54/`. The one-time Apple validation
job is unloaded. This selective integration is merged into `main`; the original
PR's route changes remain separate. No live host/headset deployment or new
TestFlight/GitHub release occurred. Physical handoff with the matching drawing
service still needs qualification. The installed release remains 0.6.6/build 38;
the next distributable change must advance the shared software version.

### Released 0.6.6 / TestFlight build 38 — September 30, 2026

The operator accepted build 37's latest test and explicitly requested commit,
push, merge, TestFlight and GitHub releases. Release 0.6.6 advances app and relay
together; internal Apple upload number 38. The release includes the approved
L2CAP stream, 15 ms controller preference, direct echo diagnostic, separate
connection/authentication deadlines and the temporary Bluetooth-only test
selector. No new input-processing changes are included.

The clean-install workflow's old `powersave`/backup assertions are corrected
to match the already implemented and tested `schedutil` installer behavior.
Release notes are `apps/tablet-setup/TestFlight/0.6.6-38.txt`.

[PR #2](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/pull/2) merged
`bluetooth-l2cap` into `main` as `b6ccbfdbc7e6cd87e01b158519c856c9acdb6980`.
Tag [v0.6.6](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/releases/tag/v0.6.6)
identifies that commit. The app archive uses release preparation commit
`7178459429672e2b8678fb47361465e9ead50528`; its Git tree exactly matches the merge.
The workspace is now on `main`.

Both pre-merge run `36798346483` and the
[main package run](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/actions/runs/36798836743)
passed all four native build/install jobs: Ubuntu 26.04 amd64 and Debian 13
arm64, 31 Linux suites each, package validation and clean install/upgrade/removal.
The GitHub release contains both installers, SHA-256 checksums and source
provenance. Debug-symbol downloads were removed at the operator's request;
normal package builds now disable their generation and require exactly one
installer. All six published assets match local hashes
and sizes. Canonical package files remain only under
`artifacts/deb/0.6.6/{ubuntu-26.04/amd64,debian-13/arm64}/`.

Apple release validation passes all 21 suites, macOS and visionOS
simulator/device compilation, signed archive/distribution export, bundle and
provisioning checks, and matching dSYM UUIDs. Upload completed at 17:59 PDT.
Apple readback confirms **VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING**, with exact tester notes and
the saved Standard / No France compliance baseline verified. Evidence, source,
IPA and archive are under `artifacts/testflight/0.6.6/build-38/`. GUI signing jobs
are unloaded. Next Apple build number: 39. This release was delivered through
TestFlight; no direct install of build 38 onto the headset was performed.

Relay02 was upgraded to the published arm64 0.6.6 package at 18:04 PDT. Package
hash, installed file verification and configuration checks pass. Service PID
3123 is active with zero restarts, advertising L2CAP PSM 128 and applying the
15 ms preference. The live CPU governor is schedutil. All 29 pre-upgrade
configuration, identity and Bluetooth state files have unchanged hashes.
Private backup: `/var/backups/plank-avp-relay/release-0.6.6/` on relay02.

Retain the known limitation that initial radio establishment can still be slow;
do not describe this release as proof that every Bluetooth startup failure is
resolved. Release-package startup is verified; no new physical drawing test was
performed after this package upgrade.

### Reboot acceptance and startup deadline correction — build 37

The operator rebooted relay02 at 17:25 PDT September 30. First Tablet Test
reported “Bluetooth interrupted”; the next test was smooth, described as the
best yet. The startup preference survived: relay applied/read back 15 ms at
17:25:46 and advertised immediately afterward. PID 805, restart count zero,
no backlog exception or adapter reset. The installed source matches `d7a9d1a`.
AVP logs confirm the successful post-reboot link negotiated 15 ms, latency zero,
supervision 720 ms at 17:29:19. The Wacom attached at 17:29:23; the failed first
attempt therefore preceded active tablet input in this boot.

Fresh AVP logs identify a concrete app deadline conflict. First startup begins
17:28:18.626, discovers the relay at 19.122, then the app cancels the pending
physical connection at 31.015 (~12.4 s). `RelayManagementConnection.requests`
wrapped `socket.connect()` and authentication in one 12-second timer, truncating
the BLE transport's own 20-second startup budget. The automatic retry begins
32.081 and ends 34.907 as the app becomes inactive; do not call that second
cancellation a separate radio failure. The next manual test completes setup
in 9.57 s and streams normally. No first-attempt GATT/L2CAP/authorization/input
session reached the relay. Unrelated devices' `762` errors in the AVP log are
not this relay's errors. The reason the initial radio connection took so long
is still unknown; the later relay packet capture started after both attempts.

Build 37 lets each transport own connection startup (BLE 20 s, TCP 8 s), then
starts the unchanged 12-second authentication deadline. Explicit cancellation
still closes the socket and releases management ownership. It does not change
tablet capture, streaming, rendering, radio settings, trust or retries.
All 21 Apple suites pass, including a real 13-second simulated startup followed
by encrypted management, plus cancellation during startup without sending any
protocol bytes. Simulator compilation, signed archive/export, bundle/profile
and dSYM checks pass. This fixes the contradictory deadline; it does not prove
the radio would have connected within 20 seconds on the failed attempt.

App 0.6.5/build 37 installed in place via mac34 at approximately 17:40 PDT;
installed-app readback confirms version/build. No TestFlight upload or relay
deployment in this follow-up. Relay remains 0.6.5 with the `d7a9d1a` development
update. Exact source, IPA, symbols, logs and provenance are under ignored
`artifacts/development/0.6.5/build-37`; GUI jobs are unloaded. Live acceptance
of the corrected startup remains pending. Next development build number: 38.
Paired diagnostic evidence is private in `captures/20260930-reboot-1729`.
A new ten-minute radio capture `plank-build37-startup-capture` began at
17:42:48 PDT, expires 17:52:48, file `/var/tmp/plank-build37-startup/trace.btsnoop`.
It does not survive reboot. Relay remains PID 805; no service restart occurred.

### 15 ms Bluetooth preference — September 30, 17:21 PDT

Checkpoint committed and pushed first as `586cbab` on `bluetooth-l2cap`, as
requested. Subsequent wireless testing left app 0.6.5/build 36 unchanged.
Two baseline drawing runs at 30 ms hit the half-second pending-input guard at
17:03:47 and 17:04:48; the relay process did not crash. Delivery was roughly
114–132 input records/s with controller completions around 120 ms.

The selected controller's default LE interval was then set to 15 ms, latency
zero, supervision 720 ms. AVP accepted the request and HCI confirmed 15 ms.
The operator reports three smooth tablet runs (17:07:28–17:08:20,
17:08:45–17:09:11, 17:16:15–17:16:50), including Tablet → Relay → Tablet.
Drawing sustained about 200 input records/s; controller completions were
typically 25–35 ms. These timings are not pen-to-display latency measurements.
Read-only 5 Hz socket-memory measurements show no sustained send backlog.

The brief return to original defaults at 17:10:13 did not produce a drawing
comparison: the next physical link timed out, followed by establishment
failures (`0x3e`) before any tablet observer started. The operator saw
“Bluetooth interrupted.” Restoring 15 ms at 17:15 led to the third smooth run;
do not claim this proves the separate startup failure is fixed. Earlier good
30 ms runs also exist. The improvement is promising, not long-term acceptance.

The relay now applies and verifies this preference before advertising, using
the existing bounded MGMT interface. It reapplies at service startup and
adapter re-registration. These are defaults for new LE links on the selected
adapter; the central still chooses actual timing. BR/EDR tablet capture,
sample ordering, buffering, authentication, TCP and Apple code are unchanged.
Missing/rejected/mismatched settings fail Bluetooth registration through its
existing retry path while TCP remains available. All 31 Linux CTest suites
pass, including new configuration/readback and registration checks.

Development deployment: updated `controller.py` and `bluez.py` installed on
relay02 with original files saved privately; hashes match this source. Service
restarted deliberately at 17:20:29, PID 10994, active/advertising, Wacom attached,
15 ms preference read back. This verifies service restart, not a full reboot
or a post-deployment drawing test. App and relay version remain 0.6.5; no new
deb, app build or TestFlight upload. Existing package rules include these files
on the next build. Do not reinstall the older deb and expect this update.

Evidence and lab scripts: private `captures/20260930-queue-1702`. Original
kernel defaults were interval 24–40 (30–50 ms), latency 0, supervision 42
(420 ms); actual baseline AVP links used 30 ms/720 ms. Trial and final defaults
are 12/12/0/72. The rollback timer is stopped; temporary capture/sampler units
are stopped. The first `/proc/net/l2cap` sampler missed accepted sockets and
must not be cited as queue evidence; the corrected pidfd/TIOCOUTQ sampler
reports allocated socket memory including SKB overhead, not queued payload
bytes. New AVP sysdiagnose collection failed on mac34; this session's packet
measurements come from the relay, not a fresh paired AVP archive.

### Build 36: variable wireless latency measured — September 30

Operator reports reliable connections, slow `Bluetooth · L2CAP`, fast network,
then a much better Bluetooth run without any intervening deployment or radio
change. Keep the Wacom wireless for further tests; USB comparison is unavailable.

Paired logs and the relay HCI trace establish a transport backlog. Earlier good
drawing delivered about 200 input records/s; slow periods delivered 110–130/s,
and the worst run 64–73/s. In that run, the last incoming Wacom pen frames arrive
at 16:41:15.189, but queued input records continue leaving the relay until
16:41:19.117. These are relay-side timestamps, not measured pen-to-display latency.
Controller completion median rises from 52 ms in the earlier good capture to
119 ms across the current capture. Wacom-to-relay delivery also slows during
the poor dual-Bluetooth runs. Radio scheduling/contention is a lead, not proven
causation. All captured headset links still use 2M PHY, 30 ms interval and
251-byte data length. No evidence of L2CAP credit starvation or relay restart.

Current AVP logs show the app discovery scan stopped during streaming. OS
background scanning changes overlap only part of the slowdown; do not claim
an app-scanner fix or a specific radio culprit. The latest improved session
16:42:53–16:43:48 has AVP logs but falls after the first packet capture expired.
The relay's half-second guard only covers pending capture data, not everything
already accepted by the Bluetooth socket/kernel/controller. Increasing buffers
would hide rather than resolve the delay. Next work: measure that send queue
and compare wireless sessions; separately evaluate a shorter BLE interval.

Evidence and analysis scripts are private in `captures/20260930-build36-latency`.
AVP sysdiagnose was recovered through mac34's device file service after the
collection command timed out. No product-code/configuration changes, build 37,
package deployment or TestFlight upload in this latency investigation.

### IMG_0068: remove the diagnostic preflight — development build 36

After the radio reset, the 16:21 test establishes Bluetooth and completes
plaintext status. IMG_0068 says `L2CAP PSM already connected`. AVP logs confirm
stream close at 16:21:48.362, next open at 48.363, and CoreBluetooth rejection
at 48.367. Relay sees the previous channel disconnect at 48.389 and no echo
request. Build35's retained link avoided physical teardown but reopened its
PSM before OS channel teardown. Its mock link did not reproduce that delay.

Build36 removes the diagnostic's unnecessary status preflight: route selection
uses the echo operation itself, one channel for all three payloads. Cleanup
precedes fallback or UI release; Bluetooth-only remains strict. The build35
link/session abstraction is removed, and tablet testing returns to the prior
authenticated status/observer lifecycle. No input timing, relay protocol,
package, or radio changes. Initial radio failures and drawing backlog remain
unresolved. All 21 Apple suites pass, the simulator compiles, and signed archive,
development provisioning and dSYM checks pass. Build36 installed in place on
the AVP via mac34 at approximately 16:32 PDT. Exact source/artifacts/evidence
are under ignored `artifacts/development/0.6.5/build-36`; no TestFlight upload.
Live acceptance is pending. New bounded capture `plank-direct-echo-build36-capture`
started 16:32:40 PDT, expires 16:42:40. Previous capture is stopped. Relay remains
0.6.5/PID811/NRestarts0. Paired failure evidence is private under
`captures/20260930-build35-after-reset`.

### Build 35: initial radio connection fails before handoff — 2026-09-30

The operator reports Relay Connection Failed. Paired logs show the first
attempt starts 16:13:09, discovers the relay at 16:13:11.557, and times out at
16:13:29.202 establishing the initial Bluetooth link. It never reaches service
discovery, status, or echo. Relay HCI reports four short connection attempts
ending with `0x3e` (Connection Failed to be Established); matching AVP logs fail
the remote-version exchange with status 762 and retry. The physical connection
ownership change has not yet received live acceptance. These failures occur
before that handoff; the underlying controller/RF/OS cause remains unproven.

USB autosuspend is disabled and the adapter remains active; Wi-Fi is on 5 GHz,
CPU uses schedutil, and no new USB/kernel errors occurred. Service PID 811 and
restart count zero remain unchanged. Both device logs are saved privately in
`captures/20260930-build35-failure`. No app/package/configuration changes here.

After saving the failed trace, the relay Bluetooth radio was power-cycled via
BlueZ at 16:19 PDT. Advertising and L2CAP PSM 128 returned at 16:19:16; tablet
enrollment remains saved. A new ten-minute capture is running under
`plank-handoff-build35-reset-capture`, expires 16:29:10 PDT, and awaits one
Bluetooth-only Test Relay Connection retry. Original capture is stopped.

### Operation-owned Bluetooth link — development build 35

The operator approved fixing the diagnostic handoff first. `RelayBLELink`
owns CoreBluetooth discovery and the physical connection. `RelayBLESession`
retains that link across status and echo/observer channels for one operation;
`RelayBLEAttempt` owns only a channel unless used outside that scope. Failed
physical links are retired, startup cancellation invalidates pending callbacks,
and completion/cancellation awaits physical cleanup before releasing the UI.
Test Relay cancellation now follows the same cleanup reservation as Test Tablet.

Apple regression coverage exercises status-to-echo reuse, all three byte tests,
partial writes, corrupt replies, cancellation and failed-link replacement.
Software version remains 0.6.5 for both app and installed relay; development
build 35 is an app-only lifecycle correction. No relay package, sample timing,
backlog guard, radio setting, TCP path or retry deadline changes in this fix.
All 21 Apple test suites pass, the visionOS simulator compiles, and the signed
device archive/development export passes bundle, provisioning and symbol checks.
Build 35 installed in place on the AVP through mac34 at 16:09 PDT September 30;
live AVP acceptance remains pending. Exact source snapshot, hashes, symbols and
build/install evidence are under `artifacts/development/0.6.5/build-35` (ignored).
No TestFlight upload. A ten-minute relay capture started at 16:10:09 PDT under
`plank-handoff-build35-capture`, expiring at 16:20:09; service PID 811 and restart
count zero were unchanged. Test Bluetooth-only Test Relay Connection first,
then Test Tablet. Do not treat this lifecycle fix as proof the separate drawing
backlog is resolved.

### Test Relay handoff failure captured — 2026-09-30

The operator emphasized that Test Relay fails while Test Tablet works. Matching
AVP logs and a relay HCI trace now locate the 15:46 PDT diagnostic failure:
its plaintext status bootstrap completes, closes its connection at 15:46:16.542,
and the new echo attempt attaches to the system-connected peripheral at
15:46:16.565. The OS explicitly says that device is already disconnecting.
Physical disconnection completes at 16.572; OS reconnect attempts never
establish a new link, and the app times out at 15:46:37.443. The relay trace
contains the full status response and its controller completions, then remote
physical disconnection and advertising re-enable; **no echo channel or test
payload ever starts**. This is a startup/handoff failure, not an echo-throughput
failure or proof that the Wacom transport cannot work.

`testRelayConnection()` performs `availableAddress()` (plaintext status) then
`testConnection()` on another connection. `startReadings()` uses authenticated
status/observer sessions and retries the whole operation up to four times.
Shared BLE startup recovery only retries a delivered early-disconnect error;
it does not recover this pending-connect timeout. This difference can explain
contradictory user-visible results. The OS does attempt reconnection after the
handoff: do not claim it never retries or that the underlying controller/RF
reason for failed establishment has been proven.

Recommended design correction: keep ownership of the physical BLE link across
the preliminary exchange and actual operation, with common lifecycle handling
for diagnostics and tablet testing. Avoid solving it only by extending
deadlines or adding more operation-level retries. No implementation/deployment
change was made in this investigation. The drawing backlog remains separate.
Evidence is in private `captures/20260930-echo-1546`; full AVP archive stays on
mac34. The bounded radio capture stopped as scheduled at 15:52:29 PDT; relay
service remained active, PID 811, restart count zero.

### Fresh-boot failure, smooth automatic retry — 2026-09-30

The relay rebooted at 15:39 PDT (outside this investigation). With `schedutil`
still active, the operator reported severe latency and disconnect. The first
observer opened at 15:41:17.497, Bluetooth tablet input attached at 15:41:23,
and the relay's half-second pending-input guard closed the session at 15:41:27.
The AVP logged channel closure at 15:41:31.960. Service PID 811 remained active
with restart count zero. The automatic observer retry opened at 15:41:33.699;
the operator twice confirmed it was smooth, and no further guard error was
recorded through the 15:45 check.

AVP logs confirm the retry reused the **same physical BLE link**, opening fresh
management/observer L2CAP channels. Both failed and recovered sessions used
2M PHY, 30 ms interval, zero peripheral latency, 251-byte data length, matching
L2CAP MTUs and the same initial AVP credit grant/priority. This is not evidence
of a faster negotiated radio mode after retry. Session queues were reset;
why the first session backed up remains unresolved. Tablet reconnection during
the first stream is another startup difference, not an established cause.
No Test Relay byte-test stage occurred in this app-log interval.

Both device logs are saved privately. A new radio capture began at 15:42:29,
after recovery, and cannot explain packet timing during the failed attempt.
It is bounded to ten minutes (expires 15:52:29 PDT) under transient unit
`plank-drawing-capture-1542`. No code/configuration/deployment changes were made.

### Drawing disconnect and diagnostic handoff — 2026-09-30

Relay and AVP logs agree on the 15:31 PDT drawing failures: the relay closed
the session at 15:31:19 and 15:31:38 because input was over half a second
behind; the AVP reported L2CAP closure about 2–3 seconds later. Service PID
and restart count stayed unchanged. This is a deliberate backlog disconnect,
not a process crash. The underlying cause of the backlog remains unresolved;
there is no radio packet capture of those failed drawing attempts.

The subsequent captured Bluetooth drawing session ran about 31 seconds
(15:35:11–42) without that guard firing. The operator reported low, acceptable
latency and later clarified that Test Relay had failed before this successful
Test Tablet run. No software, radio or governor change was made between these
attempts; `schedutil` remained active. The successful radio capture shows a
30 ms interval, zero peripheral latency, 2M PHY and 251-byte data length.
Diagnostic collection added background activity, so one good run is not proof
of a fix. Capture has stopped; private evidence includes both device logs and
the successful radio trace.

The operator suspects a successful Test Relay leaves a connection affecting
Test Tablet. Source cleanup closes its echo streams on success and failure;
the AVP explicitly confirmed the preceding echo channel closed at 15:31:05.163,
before the failed drawing channel opened at 15:31:07.562. This argues against
an overlapping echo channel consuming bandwidth in that attempt. CoreBluetooth
can retain the underlying physical link; an effect from link reuse remains
unproven. Next useful comparison is direct tablet testing versus diagnostic
then tablet testing, recording connection parameters and queue behavior in
both. Do not increase buffering or relax the backlog guard on this evidence.

### Intermittent connection timeout — 2026-09-30

Follow-up at 15:07 again found the relay but never completed Bluetooth link
establishment before the app deadline. A temporary runtime powersave comparison
at 15:09–15:14 had no recorded retry; it is inconclusive. `schedutil` was restored
and verified, without a service restart. A new bounded 600-second radio capture
was armed at 15:15:31 PDT for the next operator retry; it expires at 15:25:31.
Details and capture paths are in the private deployment notes. Do not mistake
the earlier capture (started after the failure) for evidence of that failure.

After the governor change, the operator reported a timeout in **Test Relay
Connection**, before tablet readings. AVP logs retrieved through mac34 locate
the 14:55–14:56 failures at Bluetooth link establishment: discovery succeeded,
but the OS repeatedly logged remote-version exchange failure (status 762),
disconnection and retry before the app reached service discovery. The status
alone does not establish the controller/firmware/RF cause. No packet trace of
those failed attempts was available.

One bounded relay radio capture recorded the requested repeat at 14:58:56–57.
The operator confirmed all three round trips passed; trace shows bootstrap,
handoff and 64/512/1024-byte echoes on LE L2CAP, 30 ms connection interval,
zero peripheral latency, 2M PHY and 251-byte data length. `schedutil` remained
active; no service restart, pairing reset or transport change was made. This
pass does not establish a fix for intermittent startup or sustained pen input.
Separately, the relay logged another half-second input backlog at 14:53:26;
service PID 806 and restart count 0 were unchanged. Keep that streaming issue
distinct from these pre-service connection timeouts. Radio capture has stopped
and AVP diagnostics completed; evidence remains in private deployment notes.

### CPU governor — 2026-09-30

The operator approved `schedutil` after reporting substantially improved
Bluetooth testing with a roughly constant remaining delay. Relay02 now uses
`schedutil` on its NanoPi Zero2 / Armbian 6.18.54 kernel. Live policy readback
passed; the 1.2–2.016 GHz limits and boost setting are unchanged. The enabled
Armbian hardware optimization service reads the updated
`/etc/default/cpufrequtils` at boot. No reboot or relay restart was performed;
the relay PID/restart count stayed unchanged. Latency improvement is not yet
measured or confirmed by the operator.

The package host-configuration source and installation documentation now use
`schedutil`; all 17 hardware tests pass. The previous configuration is backed up
as `cpufrequtils.before-schedutil`, retaining the older `before-powersave` backup.
This is a source/default and live host setting change only: installed app/relay
remain 0.6.5/build34, and existing package artifacts have not been rebuilt.
Reinstalling the old package can restore its powersave default. Include the new
default in the next package build. Radio interval, CPU frequency limits,
application rendering and input polling remain unchanged.

### Installed development candidate

**0.6.5 / build34 is installed on the relay and AVP.** IMG_0067 and its
captured repeat failed between the successful L2CAP status bootstrap and the
next connection. The physical link remained up for 33 seconds after channel
closure, suppressing advertising beyond the next 20-second scan deadline.
The AVP's app logs match the packet trace: status succeeded, then the new scan
expired. This is before tablet streaming, distinct from the GATT input backlog.

The app now checks the selected relay in CoreBluetooth's system-connected
peripherals before scanning and attaches through the owning central when found.
Normal identity checks, strict Bluetooth mode, fresh scanning otherwise and the
bounded startup-disconnect retry remain. See the 0.6.5 section of
`docs/bluetooth-headset-lab.md`. The misleading “Tap Pair” timeout text now says
“Try again.” No pairing reset is needed.

App source: `77ea6c15f6165ec4826b025e9b6042ea68f36b9b`. Package source:
`e05c1c90b74f2614d6f62c0df2f19e0e14da40e6`, which corrects only Debian
changelog timestamps after lintian rejected their ordering. Apple build inputs
are identical. All 31 Linux suites and 20 Apple suites pass. macOS and visionOS
simulator compilation, device archive, development export, bundle/profile and
executable/dSYM checks pass. 247 staged source hashes were verified before
archive; GUI build/export jobs are unloaded. Simulator execution was not run.

[CI 36778027101](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/actions/runs/36778027101)
passed both package builds and both clean-install checks. Verified packages are
in `artifacts/deb/0.6.5/{ubuntu-26.04/amd64,debian-13/arm64}/` only; development
IPA, dSYMs, logs and provenance are in `artifacts/development/0.6.5/build-34/`.
Relay upgrade/configuration/dpkg checks pass, all three services are active,
and identity, headset/tablet bonds, USB mode and Wi-Fi profiles/policy remain.
AVP installation was in place via mac34; installed-app readback confirms
0.6.5/build34. No TestFlight upload, GitHub release or merge was performed.

**Physical handoff and sustained pen-pressure acceptance remain pending.**
The operator was asked to reopen 0.6.5, select Bluetooth only and first run
Test Relay Connection. Do not claim this fixes discovery or input under
pressure until the corresponding physical checks pass. Private trace and
headset logs are referenced in the private deployment notes. Next build: 35.

### Previous development candidate

**Development candidate 0.6.4 / build33 is installed on the relay and AVP.**
Source `76edb5e9886a4ffe6bb45aef6f002728800231f8` is pushed on
`bluetooth-l2cap`. The user reproduced 0.6.3's failure under pen pressure in
IMG_0065. Relay logs showed the half-second capture backlog guard twice, with
no service restart and no TCP fallback.

The approved replacement now uses a dynamic PSM exposed through GATT, then
LE credit-based L2CAP carrying existing uncompressed/authenticated messages.
The app never falls back to GATT. Details are in
[Bluetooth protocol and investigation](docs/bluetooth-headset-lab.md).
The test sheet reports Bluetooth · L2CAP only after an input sample arrives.

Validation: all 31 Linux suites and 20 Apple suites pass. Real sequenced-packet
socket tests cover Noise, ordered 80-byte samples, synthetic evdev input at
200 reports/s, MTU fragmentation, backpressure, ownership and disconnects.
Apple stream tests cover partial writes, credit stalls, cancellation and input
bounds. macOS and visionOS simulator compile; simulator execution was not run.
The signed device archive and development export pass bundle/profile and
matching executable/dSYM checks. All 247 staged source hashes match the source
commit above. GUI build/export jobs are unloaded.

[CI 36775997033](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/actions/runs/36775997033)
passed both package builds and both clean-install checks. Checksums and source
provenance are verified. Packages are in
`artifacts/deb/0.6.4/{ubuntu-26.04/amd64,debian-13/arm64}/`; development IPA,
logs, source hashes and dSYMs are in `artifacts/development/0.6.4/build-33/`.
The relay upgrade retained identity, headset/tablet bonds, USB mode and Wi-Fi
profiles/policy. All three services and configuration checks pass. Hardware
L2CAP listener and advertisement are running; no service restart since startup.
AVP install readback confirms 0.6.4/build33 through mac34, in place.

**Physical AVP L2CAP acceptance is still pending.** The operator was asked to
select Bluetooth only, run Test Tablet and draw under pressure for a minute.
A listener bind and synthetic stream tests are not radio-throughput proof.
Do not claim the pressure-triggered failure fixed until that test succeeds.
No TestFlight upload, GitHub release or merge was performed. Next development
build number: 34. Preserve the direct-install delivery policy below.

### Previous candidate and investigation

**Development candidate 0.6.3 / build32**, source
`8c5d6345b1536787ac6bac58d9014c2b965060b2`, is committed and pushed on
`bluetooth-l2cap`. The temporary Tablet-page selector offers Automatic or
Bluetooth only. It filters routes before preflight and fixes the candidate set
through every tablet-test retry. Connection diagnostics and the explicit
authorization check honor the same choice. Preference is retained across app
launches and locked during active operations; the testing sheet shows the actual
connection only after input arrives and clears it on interruption.

The policy/defaults key is isolated in `RelayTestTransport.swift`, and the picker
in `RelayTestTransportView.swift`. `PLANK_ENABLE_TRANSPORT_TESTING=OFF` hides the
control and ignores a saved Bluetooth-only preference. No protocol/identity
migration is required to remove it. Network controls and normal discovery keep
their existing routing. This candidate still uses GATT for Bluetooth, not L2CAP.

All 19 Apple suites pass, along with a separate feature-disabled build/test,
macOS and visionOS simulator compilation, device archive, development export,
bundle/profile checks and matching executable/dSYM UUIDs. Native selector
previews were inspected. All 244 staged source files match the commit above.
The simulator was compiled, not run. Physical strict-routing acceptance remains
for the operator; software checks are not an AVP radio performance measurement.

[CI 36769742023](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/actions/runs/36769742023)
passed both native package builds (31 Linux suites each) and both clean installs.
Packages are in `artifacts/deb/0.6.3/{ubuntu-26.04/amd64,debian-13/arm64}/`.
The exact arm64 package is installed on relay02; configuration/dpkg checks and
all three services pass. Upgrade retained identity, headset/tablet bonds, USB
mode and Wi-Fi profiles/policy. Linux behavior is unchanged in this candidate.
The signed app was installed in place on the AVP via mac34; artifacts, previews,
logs and dSYMs are in `artifacts/development/0.6.3/build-32/`. No TestFlight upload
or GitHub release was created. Next development build number: 33.

On 2026-09-30 the operator reported that Bluetooth-only tablet testing
disconnects within seconds while the app stays open. Live relay logs identify
the half-second input backlog guard added in 0.6.2; the daemon did not restart.
Captured GATT indication confirmations took roughly 80ms with a 512-byte
application payload limit. This transport cannot sustain the expanded observer
stream. No compression change has been applied.

The operator approved investigating a simpler L2CAP LE credit-based channel,
reusing the existing authentication and uncompressed messages first. Prove it
on the physical relay and AVP before replacing the production GATT stream or
changing the event format. Preserve the TCP reference path and model-independent
Linux tablet decoding. SDK/API availability alone is not hardware validation.

**Delivery policy:** install development builds directly on the paired AVP
through mac34. mac12 may remain the build/signing machine. Publish to TestFlight
only after the operator approves that version. The previous standing instruction
to fill in tester notes and export compliance still applies to approved uploads;
it does not authorize uploading every development iteration. Preserve the app's
bundle identity and existing relay trust during installation; do not uninstall
the app as a routine deployment step. Keep device IDs and signing resources in
private deployment notes. Development provisioning must include the target AVP.

Direct installation has now been verified using the accepted 0.6.2/build31
archive, exported with development signing on mac12 and installed in place by
mac34. The headset is paired, Developer Mode is enabled, and its device is now
registered for development provisioning. No new binary was uploaded to
TestFlight. This establishes delivery only; it contains no L2CAP change.
The export/profile/install scripts are on the `bluetooth-l2cap` work branch.
Development signature/profile checks also rejected an unregistered headset and
the distribution archive. Installed-app readback confirms 0.6.2/build31 and an
accessible container. Remote app launch initially timed out, then succeeded
after the operator's "try now". Retained relay trust still needs app-level
confirmation; successful in-place installation alone does not establish it.
On relay02, a read-only capability probe successfully bound/listened on a
dynamic LE L2CAP PSM and closed the socket. Python's Bluetooth bind tuple lacks
the address-type field there; an explicit Linux sockaddr_l2 via libc was needed.
No L2CAP relay service, app transport or wire-protocol implementation has been
applied yet; the installed 0.6.3 control isolates the existing Bluetooth path.

## Previous accepted release — 0.6.2 tablet test fidelity

On 2026-09-30 the operator reported that the tablet test works much better and
requested commit, push and merge. **0.6.2 / TestFlight 31 was the accepted
baseline, now superseded by 0.6.6 above.** Its implementation is on `main`.
This confirms the operator's qualitative improvement, not measured
physical report rates or separate acceptance of every transport.

The operator authorized a larger testing popup and a focused correction based
on the working PLANK raw-report paths. The managed observer now retains each
completed evdev report, including timestamps and short pen/button transitions,
and sends existing encrypted records without the former 20Hz snapshot limit.
TCP flushes immediately when writable. Queues are bounded to 256 reports and
half a second; overflow ends the test instead of silently dropping input.
No tablet model rate, new driver, prediction or smoothing layer was added.

The Setup app uses a large testing sheet with an aspect-preserving pen area
and a pressure-sensitive trail. Frequent updates are isolated to its test
observable object. Stop/dismiss/tab/inactivity cancellation keeps the existing
connection reservation. Details compare source and received report rates using
separate clocks; input includes pen/pad/touch and receipt excludes heartbeats.
This is not a one-way latency or display-frame-rate measurement.

Release source **5a4c41901d3154151272c89d889cfea99ba31266** is committed and
pushed on main. [CI 36753729937](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/actions/runs/36753729937)
passed both native package builds and both clean-install jobs, with 31 Linux
suites per architecture. All 18 Apple suites, macOS and visionOS simulator
compilation, signed device archive/export and executable/dSYM checks passed.
The simulator was compiled, not run. The native offscreen pen preview was
inspected. All 238 Mac source files matched the committed source hashes.

[Release v0.6.2](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/releases/tag/v0.6.2)
points to that source; all eight published asset digests were verified.
Canonical installers are only in `artifacts/deb/0.6.2/ubuntu-26.04/amd64/` and
`artifacts/deb/0.6.2/debian-13/arm64/`. Apple **0.6.2 / upload 31** is VALID /
IN_BETA_TESTING; exact test notes and saved Standard / No France compliance
were applied and read back. Artifacts, logs, previews, checksums and provenance
are in `artifacts/testflight/0.6.2/build-31/`. All Mac one-shot build jobs are
unloaded. Next Apple upload: **32**.

The exact arm64 package is installed on the live relay. Upgrade unit exit0,
dpkg verification, all three configuration checks and all three services pass.
Identity, headset/tablet bonds, USB mode, Wi-Fi profiles and Wi-Fi policy were
retained; the policy comparison excludes only transient requestID/fingerprint
receipts. A root-only backup precedes installation. Bluetooth advertising and
TCP discovery/listening were active at deployment. No qualifying Wacom input
device was connected during that agent check; the operator subsequently
reported the improved behavior and accepted the release as recorded above.

A paced synthetic 200-report/s source passed through capture and real Noise/TCP
sockets with all 200 reports intact, 199.8 reports/s received, 3.09ms mean and
6.41ms maximum local input-to-decode delay. These are software loopback results,
not physical Wacom, Bluetooth, AVP rendering or end-to-end latency measurements.
Any further performance qualification should record physical input/received
rates and the transport in use, exercise pressure/quick taps and test dismissal,
and compare network with Bluetooth. Do not infer equivalent radio throughput
or measured latency from the operator's qualitative acceptance or loopback test.

## Previous accepted baseline — 0.6.1 / upload 30

The operator approved **0.6.1 / TestFlight 30** on 2026-09-30 and requested
commit/push on `main`. It is superseded by the accepted 0.6.2 release above.

Work is now on `main` in the independent public
[`Instinctual/plank-avp-relay`](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay)
repository. The complete ancestry of the previous `visionos-tablet-setup`
branch through `53b1a22313921addaa3b36f59a175dc8336958db` is preserved.
Local `origin` points to this new repository; `fork` retains
`instinctual/plank-tablet-relay` and `upstream` retains
`cnoellert/plank-tablet-relay`. The old local main is retained as
`upstream-main` in the original checkout. The primary development checkout is
now `~/dev/plank-avp-relay`. Historical CI and fixed-snapshot links continue to point to
the old repository where those records were generated. GPL and third-party
attributions are retained. The original parent main
`465c11a9708bfce0c155502844ca8d53e4370390` is already included. The earlier
requested pull/rebase completed without replay. The new repository preserves
that ancestry; no upstream merge was performed during this migration.
Root PLANK and its unrelated work remain untouched. Machine access, signing
jobs and deployment details belong in the operator's private notes.

Shared release **0.6.1** extends automatic tablet-test stopping to the Select
Relay tab. Both destination tabs wait for the existing disconnect reservation;
returning to Tablet does not restart testing or discard relay selection/trust.

Wi-Fi now offers **Join Network…**, which opens a picker and immediately requests
a fresh scan. Stale nearby results are cleared while the scan runs. Rows show
name, signal, a lock for secured networks and the connected checkmark. Saved
credentials are reused; new networks open the Join/password form. The picker
has Scan Again and **Other Network…** for a hidden network. Saved networks and
their three-dot menus remain on the main page. Missing/disabled Wi-Fi keeps a
visible, disabled Join action with the relay's status/reason. Editing pauses
background polling and passwords are cleared on submission/dismissal/back.
Linux behavior is unchanged; packages advance to match the app.

Release source `2bad76fb452f4d48fb0be487f7f6038564c8bfcc` passed **31 Linux
suites per architecture** and **18 Apple suites**, macOS build, visionOS simulator
compilation and signed device archive/export with matching executable/dSYM
UUIDs. Native offscreen main, picker, scanning, empty and unavailable previews
were inspected. The simulator was compiled, not run. Physical AVP tab switching
and Wi-Fi joining were not independently observed during this validation.

Apple upload **30** is **VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING** with tester notes and the saved
Standard / No France compliance applied and read back. Artifacts are under
`artifacts/testflight/0.6.1/build-30/`; all one-shot Mac jobs are unloaded.
Next Apple upload: **31**.

Both native package builds and both clean-install jobs passed in
[CI 36681720970](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/actions/runs/36681720970).
The [v0.6.1 release](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/releases/tag/v0.6.1)
tag matches the source and all eight asset digests were verified.

The exact published arm64 package is installed on the live relay. Package and
all three configuration checks pass, with all three services active. Identity,
headset/tablet bonds, USB mode and Wi-Fi profiles retained their hashes. The
strict upgrade wrapper flagged Wi-Fi policy.json because its request receipt ID
and fingerprint changed during installation; comparison confirmed every other
policy field was retained. The package installation itself succeeded. Private
backup and verification evidence remain in the operator notes.

Installers, optional symbols, checksums and provenance now belong only in
`artifacts/deb/<version>/<distribution>-<version>/<architecture>/`. The top-level
installer/checksum convenience copies have been removed after verifying their
versioned counterparts. The builder and CI use the versioned location; each
folder's `SHA256SUMS` covers its packages and metadata. Historical delivery
sections below describe the previous layout. The subsequent output-layout change
does not change app or installed relay behavior or replace published 0.6.1 assets.

The output-layout change `e06f43692b2999084f965767f5e298d3eff82a4b` passed both
native builds and both clean installs in
[CI 36682634733](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/actions/runs/36682634733).
Both downloaded CI artifacts were checked: no top-level installer/checksum
copies, and all versioned package/metadata checksums passed. These validation
packages remain in `artifacts/ci/36682634733/`; canonical release artifacts retain
the exact published source and hashes from `2bad76f`.

## Previous delivery — 0.6.0

Shared release **0.6.0** adds USB Wacom setup, management and automatic input
selection. A single USB tablet takes priority over a saved Bluetooth selection;
unplugging permits the saved Bluetooth tablet to resume. Explicit relay.conf
selection is still authoritative. Input detection uses vendor/physical ancestry
and pen/pressure capabilities, including pen-only tablets without ExpressKeys.
No product/generation allowlist is used.

USB status supplies name, serial/port and active selection. Manage Tablets shows
USB devices separately, with no fictitious MAC or Bluetooth pairing/removal.
An unowned relay can approve only its initiating encrypted session through
Finish Setup after opening verified USB input. Public status never enrolls a
headset; existing ownership checks remain. TCP/input stay available without a
Bluetooth adapter and unavailable Bluetooth actions are disabled in the app.

Source `d58b2e5dc51af273f8214e8424b48fb5f107fe5b` passed **31 Linux suites**
and **18 Apple suites**, macOS build, visionOS simulator compilation and signed
device archive/export with matching executable/dSYM UUIDs. The simulator was
compiled, not run. Regressions cover USB priority/fallback, multiple-device
selection, pen-only detection, absent radio, failed USB verification, ownership
retention and real Noise/TCP setup plus position/pressure frames with simulated
hardware. Native offscreen USB previews were inspected.

The installed relay captured the operator moving the USB pen: **324 reports**,
137 distinct values on each position axis, and 116 pressure values spanning
**0–6,858 of 8,191**. USB remained attached throughout the 90-second capture.
This used the installed capture code alongside the daemon without grabbing or
modifying the input devices. Raw capture summaries remain private. The running
TCP service reports active USB input and no Bluetooth adapter. Three local TCP
round trips passed (1,600 bytes each direction). Physical AVP reception and USB
unplug/replug still require operator acceptance; this was not a headset trace.

Apple upload **29** is **VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING**, with exact tester notes and
the saved Standard / No France compliance applied and read back. Artifacts are
in `artifacts/testflight/0.6.0/build-29/`. All one-shot Mac build/upload jobs are
unloaded. Next Apple upload: **30**.

Both native builds and both clean-install jobs passed in
[CI 36675629697](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/actions/runs/36675629697).
Installers are directly in `artifacts/`, with checksums/provenance under
`artifacts/deb/0.6.0/<platform>/<arch>/`. The
[v0.6.0 release](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/releases/tag/v0.6.0)
tag matches the source and all eight asset digests were verified.

The exact arm64 package is installed on the live relay. Upgrade, package and
configuration checks pass; all three services are active. Relay identity,
headset/tablet bonds, USB network mode, Wi-Fi policy and profiles were retained.
Private backups, capture evidence and access details remain in operator notes.

## Previous delivery — 0.5.9

Shared release **0.5.9** simplifies Manage Tablets. Saved tablet rows have
consistent alignment, persistent MAC addresses, selected/connection status and
three-dot action menus matching saved Wi-Fi networks. Remove Tablet confirms
the name/address and retains headset approval. Select Tablet appears only for
another saved tablet; Reconnect is offered for the selected offline tablet.
A retained tablet still supports finishing setup after ownership reset.

Add Tablet remains available after removing the last tablet, while testing
stays disabled until a tablet is available. Diagnostics appears only on the
main Tablet page. One Done button closes management; idle monitoring no longer
shows a busy spinner or a second Cancel button. Linux behavior is unchanged;
its version advances to match the app.

Source `8bb5f1dacd06732f68f18a037e0ae99c6724c1d6` passed **31 Linux suites**
and **18 Apple suites**, macOS build, visionOS simulator compilation and signed
device archive/export with matching executable/dSYM UUIDs. Native offscreen
previews of saved, scanning and empty-after-removal pages were inspected.
The simulator was compiled, not run. Physical headset layout/menu interaction
and removal/re-pairing remain operator acceptance checks.

Apple upload **28** is **VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING**, with exact tester notes and
the saved Standard / No France compliance applied and read back. Artifacts are
in `artifacts/testflight/0.5.9/build-28/`. All one-shot Mac build/upload jobs are
unloaded. Next Apple upload: **29**.

Both native package builds and both clean-install jobs passed in
[CI 36673957255](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/actions/runs/36673957255).
Both installers are directly in `artifacts/`, with checksums/provenance under
`artifacts/deb/0.5.9/<platform>/<arch>/`. The
[v0.5.9 release](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/releases/tag/v0.5.9)
tag matches the exact source; all eight published asset digests were verified.

The matching arm64 package is installed on the live relay. Its upgrade and
configuration/package checks passed, and all three services are active.
Identity, headset/tablet pairings, USB mode, Wi-Fi policy and profiles were
retained. The private state backup and access details remain in operator notes.

## Previous delivery — 0.5.8

Shared release **0.5.8** makes Connection Diagnostics a permanent section on
the Tablet page. Progress and results remain visible. The separate Headset
Authorization section and handshake-only check are removed; the manual check
now reads the relay’s explicit saved headset approval. Recovery instructions
remain in diagnostics.

The Ethernet-loss investigation found that the relay and its Wi-Fi stayed up,
while the AVP continued resolving the withdrawn wired addresses before falling
back to Bluetooth. There was no app process restart. The exact rendered Network
reset/disable symptom was not independently captured. Private device logs and
host evidence remain in operator notes.

Authenticated Wi-Fi status now reports the actual TCP listener port. The app
retains literal Wi-Fi addresses as routes to the same pinned relay identity and
tries them before Bluetooth when the discovered route fails. Unknown or failed
refreshes do not clear the last confirmed settings; a connection/reconnection
message identifies the current status. No network mutation is replayed. USB
remains Ethernet-only, with physical-cable gating in both modes.

Source `d5c2b7972420ad3f2c631e63769368bad3c7b34c` passed **31 Linux suites**
and **18 Apple suites**, macOS build, visionOS simulator compilation and signed
device archive/export, including matching executable/dSYM UUIDs. The simulator
was compiled, not run. Tests cover authenticated listener-port reporting,
literal-address validation, retained relay identity and Wi-Fi-before-Bluetooth
route selection. Physical AVP cable handover and the final rendered UI remain
operator acceptance checks.

Apple upload **27** is **VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING** with exact tester notes and
the saved Standard / No France compliance applied and read back. Artifacts are
in `artifacts/testflight/0.5.8/build-27/`. All one-shot Mac build/upload jobs are
unloaded. Next Apple upload: **28**.

Both native package builds and clean-install jobs passed in
[CI 36672129296](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/actions/runs/36672129296).
Both installers are directly in `artifacts/`; metadata and checksums are under
`artifacts/deb/0.5.8/<platform>/<arch>/`. The
[v0.5.8 release](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/releases/tag/v0.5.8)
tag matches the exact source and all eight published asset digests were verified.

The exact arm64 package is installed on the live relay. Package/configuration
checks and all three services pass. Identity, headset/tablet bonds, USB mode,
Wi-Fi policy and profiles were retained through the private-backed-up upgrade.
Three post-upgrade TCP round trips to the relay’s Wi-Fi address passed from the
nearby Mac (1,600 bytes each direction). Ethernet had been reconnected by that
check; this is not a physical AVP cable-handover acceptance result.

## Previous delivery — 0.5.7

Shared release **0.5.7** implements the requested tablet-to-network workflow.
The active input button is **Stop Testing**. Entering Network stops any active
or connecting tablet test, keeps the relay reserved until disconnect completes,
and then starts the existing background network refresh. Late input/progress
callbacks cannot revive the stopped test. Selection, tablet availability and
headset trust remain intact; returning to Tablet does not restart the test.
The duplicate Select Relay footer button is removed; use the first tab.

Release source `535b11473b164b3f04ea992e025f4c9578bcd2c7` passed **18 Apple
suites**, macOS build, visionOS simulator compilation, device build and signed
archive/export. New regressions cover stopping during connection, delayed
disconnect, late samples/completion and Network availability after stopping.
The simulator was compiled, not run; physical AVP tab interaction remains an
operator check.

Apple upload **26** is **VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING**, with exact tester notes and
the confirmed Standard / No France compliance saved and read back. Artifacts
are under `artifacts/testflight/0.5.7/build-26/`; executable and dSYM UUIDs match.
All one-shot verification/archive/export/upload jobs are unloaded. Next upload:27.

Both native packages use the same source and shared version **0.5.7**. All four
native build and clean-install jobs passed in [CI 36668923608](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/actions/runs/36668923608),
including 31 Linux suites per architecture. Linux behavior is unchanged from
0.5.6; the version advances to match the app. Installers are in `artifacts/`,
with checksums/provenance under `artifacts/deb/0.5.7/<platform>/<arch>/`.
The [v0.5.7 release](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/releases/tag/v0.5.7)
provides both installers, optional debug symbols and provenance; all eight
published asset digests were read back and verified.

The exact arm64 package is installed on the live relay. Its upgrade completed
successfully, package/config checks passed and all three services are active.
Identity, headset/tablet pairing, USB mode, Wi-Fi policy and profiles were
retained through the upgrade. Private backups and machine access details remain
in the operator notes. The previous 0.5.6 scan timings below were not rerun for
this app-only behavior change.

## Previous delivery — 0.5.6

Shared release **0.5.6** implements the approved network fixes and navigation:
**Select Relay → Tablet → Network**, with dependent tabs disabled until selection.
Selection persists across tabs; authorization is still required for controls.
Missing status no longer appears as a disabled radio or a default USB mode.

Network operations retain one authenticated connection from preflight through
completion and list retrieval. Reads/scans prefer TCP; network-changing commands
prefer Bluetooth. Failed routes cool down and mutations are never replayed after
ambiguous replies. Cancellation drains teardown before another operation starts.
Local USB/Wi-Fi helpers serve cached public reads separately from their single
backend worker, acknowledge durable requests before apply and remove the fixed
two-second delay. Scans share an existing scan and await ScanDone; they never
roll back profiles or cycle the interface on failure. Profile/ownership caches
reduce repeated D-Bus/system commands. USB remains wired-only with cable gating.

The investigation confirmed the reported screenshots showed Network with no
selected relay, while live Wi-Fi remained enabled and connected. Separate trace
evidence showed five BLE connections during a Wi-Fi operation and repeated use
of a dead TCP endpoint. Earlier supplicant scan collisions triggered unnecessary
rollback. These are distinct findings; private captures and machine details stay
in the operator notes.

Release source `01c5f031b4e091e58086acce33b09f1b32a080e4` passed **31 Linux
suites and 18 Apple suites**, macOS build and visionOS simulator compilation
(the simulator was not run). All four native package and clean-install jobs
passed in [CI 36667360948](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/actions/runs/36667360948).
Both installers are directly in `artifacts/`, with metadata under
`artifacts/deb/0.5.6/<platform>/<arch>/`. The [published v0.5.6 release](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/releases/tag/v0.5.6)
has both installers, optional debug symbols, checksums and provenance. Its tag
and all eight asset digests were read back and matched the built source/files.

The exact arm64 package is installed on the live relay. Configuration and
package verification pass, all services are active, and identity, headset/tablet
pairings, USB mode, Wi-Fi policy and profiles were retained through the upgrade.
Three actual Wi-Fi scans returned eight networks each in 5.216, 5.022 and 5.021
seconds. Across 160 local helper requests, median response was 1.74 ms and the
maximum was 13.42 ms. The connection remained on the same network, with no
sampled disconnected state or supplicant disconnect event. These timings cover
root-local IPC, not AVP/Bluetooth latency. Joining other networks, AVP interaction
and physical USB cable acceptance remain operator checks.

The app and relay both use **0.5.6** (app display `0.5.6-main`). Apple upload24
is VALID/IN_BETA_TESTING with notes/compliance verified. The subsequent UI-only
commit `fa24217` renames the input button to **Test Tablet**; its device build,
signed archive/export and bundle/symbol checks passed. Apple upload25 is **VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING**; the exact tester notes and saved
Standard / No France compliance were applied and read back. All one-shot
verification/archive/export/upload jobs are unloaded. The 31/18 suites and simulator check apply to
the preceding source; the only later source change is that button label. Both
app deliveries are retained under `artifacts/testflight/0.5.6/`. Next upload:26.

## Previous verification rebuild — 0.5.5

Shared release **0.5.5** has been rebuilt and republished from the new main
checkout at `54f6e1a4841d4faa31e81a48fedc12407990632e`. Both relay packages
and the signed app use this same source commit. This is a verification rebuild
with existing behavior and the same shared software version. The app displays
`0.5.5-main`; Apple's upload identifier stays in bundle metadata.

Both native builds passed all 30 Linux suites and all 101 libsodium tests.
All four package / clean-install jobs passed in
[CI 36646938148](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/actions/runs/36646938148).
Install/reinstall, namespace upgrades, private-state retention, removal and
configuration checks passed. The new checkout also built locally and passed
30/30 Linux tests. Both installers are in `artifacts/`, with metadata under
`artifacts/deb/0.5.5/<platform>/<arch>/`. Original run artifacts/logs are under
`artifacts/ci/36646938148/`. Root and versioned checksums pass.

The [published v0.5.5 release](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/releases/tag/v0.5.5)
provides both installers, optional debug symbols, SHA-256 checksums and build
provenance. Its tag points to the exact rebuilt source; all eight published
asset digests were read back and matched against local files. Release assets
are staged under `artifacts/releases/0.5.5/`. The preceding 0.5.5 Linux delivery
is retained under `artifacts/superseded/0.5.5/ci-36642639817/`. Generated files
remain excluded from Git.

The fresh Apple checkout passed all 17 suites, macOS build, visionOS simulator
compilation, device build, signed archive/export, bundle/privacy checks and
matching executable/dSYM UUID. The simulator was compiled, not run. Apple
upload **23** is **VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING**, with exact tester notes and the
confirmed Standard / No France compliance saved and read back. All one-shot
verification/archive/export/upload jobs are unloaded. Artifacts:
`artifacts/testflight/0.5.5/build-23/`. Next Apple upload identifier: **24**.

**Live host update is pending.** The preceding 0.5.5 arm64 installer and
private upgrade script were transferred, but SSH became unreachable through
both saved endpoints before the checksum/install command could start.
No 0.5.5 installation or pre-install state backup is claimed. Last verified
live version is **0.5.4** with retained pairings, Router mode and gateway
`10.20.30.1`. Resume the verified upgrade when the host returns and compare
identity/headset/tablet/USB-mode files against its private backup. Do not reset
saved authorization. This rebuild has not changed the installed host; stage
the newly published installer when resuming the update. USB forwarding, cable gating and app interaction remain
operator acceptance checks. Access addresses, credentials, staged paths and
private release details belong in operator notes.

## Previous repository-migration delivery — 0.5.5

Initial migration app source was
`accacc1c226a2b1a6c89c9c37bb1ce29edc6717d`; relay source
`bfbdd91e31922540b94b5c4a4889ed109b310efe` corrected Debian changelog metadata
only. All 30 Linux suites and all four package / clean-install jobs passed in
[CI 36642639817](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/actions/runs/36642639817).
The initial [CI 36642284123](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-avp-relay/actions/runs/36642284123)
failed lintian because the newest changelog date preceded an older entry;
no package from that run was installed or promoted. Recent changelog timestamps
were corrected to the release source commits rather than future-dated entries.
Apple upload 22 remains VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING, with notes/compliance verified;
its artifacts remain under `artifacts/testflight/0.5.5/build-22/`.

## Previous delivery snapshot — 0.5.4

Shared release **0.5.4** uses the fixed Router subnet `10.20.30.0/24`, with
relay/gateway `10.20.30.1`, DHCP and wired-only NAT. There is no subnet override.
Bridge addressing is unchanged. Source is
`f03a367958fee4680b32056c3821650641a9c5e0`. All 30 Linux suites and all four
native package / clean-install jobs passed in
[CI 36640704105](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-tablet-relay/actions/runs/36640704105).
Both installers are directly in `artifacts/`, with versioned metadata under
`artifacts/deb/0.5.4/<platform>/<arch>/`; root checksums pass. The previous
0.5.3 installers are retained under `artifacts/superseded/0.5.3/`.

The exact 0.5.4 arm64 package is installed on the live Zero2 and passes package
verification and all three service configuration checks. All main / USB /
Wi-Fi / Bluetooth services are active. Router mode is idle/supported, physical
Ethernet and USB are connected, and the USB interface has only the new IPv4
address `10.20.30.1/24`. networkd offered the connected USB client a DHCP lease
of `10.20.30.69`. Identity, saved headsets/tablets and USB mode were retained
byte-for-byte. Package upgrades also remove the retired `router_address` option
from customized configuration after a private backup, preserving other settings.
Clean-install CI exercises the actual postinst upgrade of that older option.

The matching app passed all 17 Apple suites, macOS build, visionOS device build,
signed archive/export, privacy/bundle checks and matching executable/dSYM UUID.
Simulator compilation was last checked in 0.5.3; there are no app behavior changes
in this release. Apple upload **21** is **VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING**, with notes and
Standard / No France compliance saved and read back. Signing/export/upload jobs
are unloaded. Artifacts: `artifacts/testflight/0.5.4/build-21/`.
Next Apple upload identifier: **22**. A two-packet ICMP probe to the offered
USB client address received no reply; it does not establish end-to-end data
forwarding. USB data forwarding and physical cable removal/restoration remain
operator acceptance checks. Access details and the
private pre-install backup belong in operator notes.

## Previous delivery snapshot — 0.5.3

Previously delivered shared release **0.5.3** fixes background Network refresh blocking, independent
Ethernet status, missing combo-dongle WLAN firmware and Zero2 USB startup /
warm-start configuration. Relay source
`3f353bc264e8de835d7c8048c9e603645ba49e6b` passed all four native package and
clean-install CI jobs and is installed on the live host. App source
`2ea56f1bbb9cec52a740b4461983cdd9ed789a0f` adds visible Wi-Fi switch progress,
action messages and clearing cached settings when a relay is deselected.
All 17 Apple suites and macOS/device/simulator builds pass. Apple upload **20**
is **VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING**, with notes and Standard / No France compliance
saved and read back. Signing jobs are unloaded. App and relay expose **0.5.3**.
Package verification passes, so no temporary hardware test copy remains on the
host. Ethernet carrier is connected and bridge DHCP works; USB preparation is
idle/supported but no USB host is attached. Wi-Fi is now enabled for the
operator's toggle investigation; a real scan found eight networks in its first
page with more available. The operator then successfully joined Wi-Fi from
the app; the host confirmed connected, an assigned address and a saved profile
for automatic reconnection. Identity,
paired-clients and tablets retained byte-for-byte across the final package
upgrade. Access details and backups remain in private notes.

Platform targets are **Ubuntu Server 26.04 / amd64** on Intel hardware and
**Armbian Minimal, Debian 13 / arm64** on the NanoPi boards. The operator
explicitly selected **6.18.54 current** for Zero2. R28S's published Armbian
image currently uses **6.1.172 vendor**; it remains physically unqualified.
Both use one Debian 13 arm64 relay package, with board-specific OS images,
drivers and hardware acceptance. See [platform matrix](docs/relay-platforms.md).
Automatic USB gadget enablement applies to Zero2 only; R28S needs its wired
uplink and USB controller configuration qualified before enablement.

Next, confirm identity replacement in app 0.5.1 using **Forget saved relay**
after the mismatch error, then pair the tablet to enroll the headset.
Verify readings cannot start with no tablet, allow a saved sleeping tablet,
and disable after removing the last tablet. Validate discovery, TCP/Bluetooth
saved authorization and live pen X/Y/pressure on AVP. Test Wi-Fi join,
wrong-password recovery, saved/hidden
networks, on/off and reboot persistence. Test Bridge and Router, USB attachment
with Ethernet link but no Internet, cable removal/restoration, reconnect after
Apply and tablet sleep/wake. USB must withdraw when Ethernet is removed even
if relay Wi-Fi is connected. Physical Wi-Fi/USB/AVP qualification remains
pending; software tests and package checks do not replace hardware acceptance.

The operator authorized autonomous relay refinement, Debian packaging and app
cleanup. The working readings path now has a managed Linux TCP/BLE service and
a simpler TestFlight app. This remains a diagnostic setup component, separate
from the legacy TCP/raw-HID workstation relay.

The operator requested a shareable implementation brief for the upstream
author's coding agent. See [AVP Bluetooth upstream handoff](docs/avp-bluetooth-upstream-handoff.md)
for the verified address-resolution and battery-plugin fixes, fixed reference
snapshot, implementation/recovery requirements and acceptance tests. Creating
this document changes no runtime code or deployed host configuration.

## Shared release 0.5.3 — final Network delivery and warm-start fix

Final relay source is `3f353bc264e8de835d7c8048c9e603645ba49e6b`; final
app source is `2ea56f1bbb9cec52a740b4461983cdd9ed789a0f` (only Apple UI,
command-encoding tests and tester notes differ). Release 0.5.3 retains the
nonblocking Network controls, independent cable status, missing WLAN firmware
and USB interface/permission fixes described under 0.5.2. It also excludes the
owned gadget MAC from automatic physical Ethernet selection on warm starts,
while requiring explicit configuration when real multiple wired ports exist.
The Zero2 passed **three consecutive USB service restarts** with these changes.
The operator's `IMG_0048.jpeg` screenshot showed the intermediate 0.5.2
ambiguous-Ethernet failure and an available Wi-Fi toggle, corroborating the
host findings. The screenshot remains outside this repository.

All 17 Apple suites passed; macOS/device/simulator builds, signed archive /
export, privacy and matching symbols passed. Simulator compiled, not run.
Final native package/clean-install
[CI 36637549606](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-tablet-relay/actions/runs/36637549606)
passed all four jobs. Apple upload 20 is VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING with notes
and Standard / No France compliance verified; signing jobs are unloaded. Local Linux suites: 30/30 pass, including warm-start physical
port selection, networkd permissions and canceled background connection order.
Final installers are `artifacts/plank-avp-relay_0.5.3_{amd64,arm64}.deb`;
metadata/debug symbols under `artifacts/deb/0.5.3/<platform>/<arch>/`.
Next Apple upload identifier after this submission: **21**.

The operator reported Enable Wi-Fi had no visible response. No accepted Wi-Fi
operation was present at initial inspection; the privileged local controller
successfully enabled the radio and performed a real scan. App controls now
show the requested switch state and adjacent progress immediately, explain
missing authorization or busy state beside the control, and report rejected
action guards. Returning to discovery clears network status/lists instead of
showing stale disabled settings from a deselected relay. The exact reason for
the operator's initial tap is not confirmed. The operator subsequently
confirmed a successful app-driven Wi-Fi join, and the host verified the active
connection / assigned address / saved reconnect profile. The final app's
switch feedback still needs operator acceptance. Mac34 was unreachable for device logs.

The live host is installed from the exact 0.5.3 arm64 package and passes
`dpkg --verify` and config checks. All main/Wi-Fi/USB/Bluetooth services are
active; USB reports idle/supported, Ethernet connected, USB host disconnected.
Core state retained byte-for-byte. Wi-Fi stayed enabled across package upgrade;
its request journal changed through scan operations, so only policy/state
values, not byte identity, are claimed for Wi-Fi. Private pre-install archive
paths and inventory belong in operator notes. Wi-Fi joining was confirmed live; final AVP switch
feedback, USB host enumeration/data transfer and physical Ethernet cable
removal/restoration still need operator acceptance.

Artifacts: `artifacts/testflight/0.5.3/build-20/`.
IPA SHA-256: `5af4c258700927ea03f144e708af85d0a4bd11ba7cd5325ceb06072b2ef5d31c`.

## Shared release 0.5.2 — responsive Network controls and hardware startup

- Periodic Network reads no longer call `beginNetworkSettings` or set global
  busy/activity. They are serial read-only background tasks, preferring TCP.
  Each finishes before the ten-second interval starts. The foreground mutation
  path retains its BLE preference and durable single-send request identifiers.
- Foreground operations cancel and await background transport teardown before
  connecting. Opening Wi-Fi entry, leaving the Network tab, changing relay or
  app inactivity cancels background work; stale canceled responses cannot
  overwrite the current view. Passive refresh retains editable controls.
- Ethernet carrier remains independent of unsupported/failed USB setup.
  A supported appliance with carrier down reports **Disconnected** and
  **Waiting for Ethernet**. Actual USB errors remain explicit.
- The tested combo dongle's WLAN probe failed with missing
  `rtw89/rtw8851b_fw.bin`, although Bluetooth firmware loaded successfully.
  The package now bundles original base / `-1` WLAN firmware from the same
  pinned linux-firmware revision and Realtek redistribution license as its
  Bluetooth bundle. Existing OS/admin/compressed firmware takes precedence.
  Recovery probes only an unbound supported WLAN interface; it does not reset
  the parent USB device or Bluetooth. Kernel firmware 0.29.41.5 loaded and the
  helper reports supported, disabled according to the saved default policy.
- Zero2 kernel 6.18.54 registers the NCM netdev on UDC binding. Configfs requires
  a numeric `plankusb%d` name pattern. Reserve the expected free `plankusb0`,
  install networkd files and forwarding guard before binding, then verify the
  resulting USB configuration. With no Ethernet link, UDC stays unbound.
  Non-secret networkd files must be 0644, despite the helper's private umask;
  private credentials/state retain their separate protections.

All **17 Apple suites** pass, including background cancellation/disconnect
ordering, no overlapping connections, retained foreground controls and status
labels. macOS/device/simulator builds, signed archive/export, privacy and
matching dSYM checks pass. Simulator compiled, not run. All 30 local Linux
suites pass; native packages and clean-install CI passed, but the final reinstall exposed
a warm-start interface-selection issue superseded by release 0.5.3.
Initial [CI 36635742190](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-tablet-relay/actions/runs/36635742190)
passed all four jobs, but hardware validation then exposed USB interface-pattern
and networkd permission issues. Those binaries are quarantined under
`artifacts/rejected/36635742190`; use only the rebuilt final packages.
Final [CI 36636601807](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-tablet-relay/actions/runs/36636601807)
passed all four jobs for `3de031f0c94acc7147ab4b9f57ca8874cadf24ff`; these
Linux binaries are quarantined under `artifacts/rejected/36636601807`.
App 0.5.2 source `316ed631ca55b9acc65bb6638233dd535831e1ad` differs only in Linux
hardware corrections and their docs/tests/changelog. Both exposed version 0.5.2. Apple upload 19 is VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING with
notes and Standard / No France compliance saved; signing jobs unloaded.
App release artifacts: `artifacts/testflight/0.5.2/build-19/`.
Next Apple upload identifier after this submission was **20**, reserved for 0.5.3.
Physical AVP Network interaction, final app Wi-Fi switch feedback, USB host enumeration, Ethernet
cable removal/restoration and pen readings remain operator acceptance work.

## Shared release 0.5.1 — tablet availability and identity recovery

- Local headset trust alone no longer enables **Start live readings**.
  The app checks Noise-authenticated tablet status on selection and again
  before observing. A selected paired tablet may be asleep; an attached USB
  tablet also qualifies. No tablet / no selection disables readings while
  retaining network management and headset ownership.
- Availability is invalidated when switching relays or reopening management;
  stale status callbacks cannot enable readings. The authorization heading
  says **Saved headset pairing** until the relay confirms current approval.
- A fresh OS creates a new relay identity. On a mismatch, **Forget saved relay**
  asks for explicit replacement confirmation and removes the selected relay's
  pending pins, canonical records and Bluetooth/TCP aliases. It retains other
  relays and the headset private key, then reopens tablet setup. Normal
  ownership transfer of an unchanged relay continues through SSH recovery.
- Live inspection of the fresh-install Zero2 showed no saved tablet and no
  approved headset. Public local TCP status confirmed initial setup and a
  current public identity. The existing app's cached authorization offered
  observation despite this. BLE logs showed authentication followed by closure;
  the changed identity is consistent with the reported write rejection.
  Physical AVP recovery/reading acceptance remains pending.

Validation: all **16 Apple suites** pass, including stale availability,
last-tablet removal, sleeping tablet, USB input and targeted Keychain-record
selection. macOS and visionOS device/simulator compile; signed archive/export,
privacy and matching dSYM checks pass. Simulator compiled, not run.
All four [package CI jobs](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-tablet-relay/actions/runs/36632410225)
pass; each native build passed 30 Linux suites, followed by clean install,
reinstall, retention, removal and migration on Ubuntu 26.04 amd64 / Debian 13
arm64. Sources differ only by the final app authorization-heading refinement.

Installers: `artifacts/plank-avp-relay_0.5.1_{amd64,arm64}.deb` with checksums.
Versioned metadata/debug symbols: `artifacts/deb/0.5.1/<platform>/<arch>/`.
The previous 0.5.0 top-level files are archived under `artifacts/superseded/`.
The host upgrade passed configuration/package verification and preserved
private state. No tablet bond or headset approval was created during inspection.

## Shared release 0.5.0 — Wi-Fi management

- Network tab now enables/disables Wi-Fi, scans, joins WPA2/WPA3 Personal and
  open networks, accepts hidden SSIDs, reconnects saved profiles, updates
  passwords and forgets networks. Secured rows show only a lock; open rows have
  no security icon/label. Connection and address status remain read-only.
- Persistent manual radio policy is independent of Ethernet carrier. Fresh
  unconfigured supported WLAN starts off; existing configured Wi-Fi remains
  untouched until an authorized action takes ownership. Off retains profiles
  and uses the selected WLAN rfkill index, leaving Bluetooth available.
- `plank-avp-relay-wifi.service` / process `plank-avp-wifi` owns the selected
  WLAN through wpa_supplicant D-Bus and systemd-networkd. The package includes
  wpasupplicant/rfkill; no manual daemon launch. NetworkManager hosts and
  missing/unqualified drivers report unavailable and retain configuration.
- Wi-Fi can carry relay TCP traffic; its DHCP/RA metric prefers normal wired
  routes. USB remains wired-Ethernet-only in Bridge and Router. No Wi-Fi AP,
  web UI, USB Wi-Fi uplink or old workstation transport was added.
- Wi-Fi commands require the current approved Noise identity. Requests are
  durably accepted before apply and continue after connection loss. Status is
  bound to the same UUID and relay key; the app does not resend mutations.
  Failed joins restore prior native profiles; interrupted operations resume.
- Configuration `/etc/plank-avp-relay/wifi.conf`; private profiles, rollback,
  ownership and operation journal `/var/lib/plank-avp-relay/wifi/` (0700/0600);
  root-only socket `/run/plank-avp-relay/wifi/control.sock`. Main relay cannot
  read the Wi-Fi state directory. No passwords in status/discovery/logs/app
  persistence. Native supplicant credentials and original backups stay private.
- Wi-Fi takes over only its selected interface on networkd appliances, preserves
  native profiles and original unit/configuration metadata, and releases its
  networkd file/unmasks prior units on removal. Removal retains private state.
  See [Wi-Fi behavior and acceptance](docs/wifi-management.md) for limits.

Validation: 30 Linux suites and 15 Apple suites pass. New tests include
16 controller/ownership/privacy cases, real isolated supplicant D-Bus profile
persistence/rollback with WPA2 raw keys, WPA3, open/hidden and raw SSID bytes,
and real authenticated TCP rejection of provisional Wi-Fi management. macOS,
visionOS device/simulator builds, signed archive/export and bundle/privacy/
dSYM checks passed. Simulator compiled, not run. Wi-Fi offscreen previews
were inspected; secured/open rows follow the requested presentation.

[Final package CI](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-tablet-relay/actions/runs/36629621596)
passed all four jobs: native Ubuntu 26.04 amd64 and Debian 13 arm64 builds,
plus clean install, reinstall, private-state retention, removal and
old-namespace migration on both distributions. Each native build passed all
30 Linux suites. Artifact hashes and source provenance were verified locally.
The operator requested removal of the old branch suffix from package naming.
Debian package version is now exactly **0.5.0**, matching `VERSION`; the
builder rejects branch suffixes and build counters. This sorts after the
previous `0.5.0~visionos-tablet-setup` package, so apt treats it as an upgrade.
Internal package name/version, architecture, source and checksums were checked.
Regular installers are directly in `artifacts/`:
`plank-avp-relay_0.5.0_amd64.deb` for Intel / Ubuntu Server 26.04 and
`plank-avp-relay_0.5.0_arm64.deb` for NanoPi / Armbian Debian 13. Both provide
the same features. Future builds also copy the main installer and checksum
to that directory. Optional `dbgsym` files contain crash-debugging symbols;
they stay with build metadata under `artifacts/deb/0.5.0/ubuntu-26.04/amd64/`
and `artifacts/deb/0.5.0/debian-13/arm64/`. Previous top-level copies are
archived in `artifacts/superseded/0.5.0~visionos-tablet-setup/`.
The generated artifacts directory is excluded from Git; CI provides downloads.
CI logs/downloads are in `artifacts/ci/36629621596/`; additional Debian 13
userspace and real isolated supplicant checks are in
`artifacts/validation/0.5.0/`. Containers do not qualify the board kernels.

Two earlier CI issues were corrected: removal must not regenerate Python
bytecode after Debian cleanup, and the retention test's dummy Wi-Fi profile
must be moved out before preparing the separate namespace-migration fixture.
Do not install the first failed-run packages retained under
`artifacts/rejected/36625702966/`. Subsequent changes from app source
`27bd518` affect Linux packaging, CI and documentation only; Apple build 17
needs no replacement. Apple readback is **VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING**, with notes
and saved Standard / No France compliance verified (`usesNonExemptEncryption=false`).

## Shared release 0.4.0 — USB Ethernet and product naming

- Linux package, command and main unit: `plank-avp-relay`;
  USB unit: `plank-avp-relay-usb.service`; admin: `plank-avp-relay-admin`.
  Configuration `/etc/plank-avp-relay/`, identity `/var/lib/plank-avp-relay/`,
  USB state in its `usb/` subdirectory. Main process label `plank-avp-relay`;
  USB process label `plank-avp-usb` fits Linux's 15-byte limit.
- `apt` replaces the old package. Post-install migration copies private state,
  config and backups before service startup, retains original copies and
  refuses conflicting identities. BlueZ tablet bonds remain in place. A
  migration stamp prevents later reinstalls from copying old settings again.
- Bonjour is now `_plank-avp-relay._tcp`; update both components. BLE UUIDs,
  wire authentication and Keychain identity namespace remain unchanged.
- Dedicated appliance uses Bridge by default, Router when selected. Physical
  wired carrier gates the USB adapter in both modes; Internet reachability is
  irrelevant. Wi-Fi is never an upstream path. Router provides IPv4 NAT and
  blocks forwarded IPv6; Bridge carries the wired LAN directly.
- Gadget support enables automatically only on Armbian NanoPi Zero2. x86
  Ubuntu Server 26.04 reports unavailable and retains its network settings.
  The package includes required networking tools. A separately privileged
  service owns networkd/configfs/boot configuration, with root-only IPC.
- Network tab separates an editable mode selector/Apply from read-only
  Ethernet and USB connection statuses. USB status uses the actual controller
  state. Status refreshes every four seconds when idle and active onscreen.
- Only a previously authorized headset can manage networking over encrypted
  TCP/BLE. Provisional setup cannot. Mode requests are durable and idempotent;
  accepted changes finish independently of the app. App reconnects across
  verified endpoints and checks the request result without replaying mutation.
- The supplied parent-folder `install-usb-gadget.sh` is unchanged. Recognized
  standalone installations are backed up and retired by the new controller,
  retaining Bridge/Router choice. Unknown installations are not overwritten.
  Non-default private subnets require explicit configuration before migration.

Software validation: all 28 Linux CTest suites and 14 Apple suites pass.
Linux includes real native identity/approval migration tests, authenticated
network-management socket tests and a real-kernel isolated nftables test.
macOS plus visionOS device/simulator compilation, signed archive/export,
bundle/privacy checks and executable/dSYM matching passed. The simulator was
compiled, not executed. Network-tab offscreen previews were inspected.

App upload was accepted at 2026-09-29T19:22:41Z. The displayed app name changed;
its App Store Connect application record and bundle identifier are unchanged.
Archive/export/upload GUI jobs are unloaded. IPA, dSYMs, previews, logs and
source provenance are retained in `artifacts/testflight/0.4.0/build-16/`.
IPA SHA-256: `ed8ef1c9970258aa1a87d0c68058d7b73d5289bdaa3dc980d3ef41e4c8fe7aef`.
arm64 dSYM UUID: `A103DE26-D5C4-39B6-932E-08E24267F72E`.

Apple API readback is **VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING**. Notes and saved Standard /
No France compliance were saved and verified (`usesNonExemptEncryption=false`).
That release used Apple upload **16**; see the current release above for the next identifier.

All four [Ubuntu 26.04 CI jobs](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-tablet-relay/actions/runs/36619511923)
pass: native amd64/arm64 builds plus clean installation/reinstallation/removal
and old-package replacement on both architectures. The upgrade fixture proves
its original native state is valid, installs the previous package namespace,
then verifies the actual new postinst preserved identity, saved approval and
custom configuration. Each native build passed all 28 relay suites, 101
libsodium tests, installed-package checks and lintian. The real-kernel nftables
check ran locally; CI can skip that subtest without the required privileges.
Final checksummed packages and source provenance are retained under
`artifacts/deb/0.4.0~visionos-tablet-setup/ubuntu-26.04/{amd64,arm64}/`;
complete CI records are in `artifacts/ci/36619511923/`. The app source predates
three Linux-only packaging/test fixes; Apple source is otherwise identical.
No host installation or physical USB/AVP testing was performed.

## Shared release 0.3.0 — previous delivery, never installed on unavailable host

App and relay source is `5e2a402c83a5573512b2524f46b0e72736a62a9f`. The visible
app version is `0.3.0-visionos-tablet-setup`; Debian uses
`0.3.0~visionos-tablet-setup`. Apple's separate upload identifier is 15.

- The new TCP adapter uses the current tablet capture, encrypted Noise codec,
  identity store and enrollment rules. It does not reuse the older standalone
  TCP/raw-HID service. One shared core admits one owning setup/readings session.
- Avahi publishes `_plank-tablet._tcp` only while the listener is running.
  The `.deb` installs its dependencies and starts the service automatically.
  TCP defaults to port 28991 on IPv4/IPv6, including upgrades retaining older
  configuration. A radio restart does not stop the network listener.
- The app browses Bonjour and BLE concurrently, checks network reachability,
  and prefers TCP. Public keys join known identities; a unique matching name
  can group unverified candidates but cannot authorize operations. Fallback
  must prove the selected/saved key. Existing headset keys and trust survive
  transport and network-address changes; no second headset enrollment is added.
- Current tablet setup is restricted until tablet verification commits the
  initiating headset. Readings can recover with a fresh authenticated session
  on an alternate endpoint. Interrupted setup mutations are never replayed.
- Network permission denial leaves Bluetooth usable. Discovery withdrawal,
  probe expiry and BLE advertisement expiry remove unavailable list entries.

Validation: all 25 Linux CTest suites and 13 Apple suites pass, including real
socket tests of Noise, authorization, input snapshots, read-only status,
competing owners, bounds, cancellation and TCP fragmentation. macOS and
visionOS device/simulator SDK compilation passed; simulator was not executed.
Signed archive/export, bundle/privacy and matching executable/dSYM checks pass.

An isolated Linux fixture using the real Avahi publisher and TCP server was
discovered and resolved by a separate Mac on the LAN. All three TCP echo round
trips (64, 512 and 1,024 bytes) passed. The fixture used temporary identity
state and no physical tablet; it has stopped. AVP TCP readings, physical
transport recovery and the host upgrade remain untested/pending.

All four [Ubuntu 26.04 CI jobs](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-tablet-relay/actions/runs/36594697071)
pass: native amd64/arm64 builds and clean install/reinstall/removal on both
architectures. Each native build passed 25 relay suites, 101 libsodium tests,
package checks and lintian. Checksums and exact source provenance were verified;
packages are retained under
`artifacts/deb/0.3.0~visionos-tablet-setup/ubuntu-26.04/{amd64,arm64}/`.
No installation was attempted on the unavailable host.

Apple accepted upload at 2026-09-29T16:13:29Z. Exact API readback is
**VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING**. Build notes and the saved Standard / No France
compliance baseline were saved and verified. Archive, export and upload GUI
jobs are unloaded. IPA, dSYMs, logs and provenance are retained under

[app discovery, trust and recovery](apps/tablet-setup/README.md).

## Shared release 0.2.1 — previous delivery, still installed on host

The operator requires identical `Major.Minor.Ancillary` numbers for the app and
relay. Both now take release `0.2.1` from `VERSION`; the Debian changelog is
checked against that file before packaging. Keep the branch description, but
do not append a build counter. The app displays `0.2.1-visionos-tablet-setup`;
the package uses Debian's prerelease separator, `0.2.1~visionos-tablet-setup`.
Apple's internal upload identifier remains separate (this upload uses 14).
Increment the shared release for delivered updates to either component.

This release also keeps each tablet's MAC address below its name in discovery
and saved connected/offline rows, and includes it in removal confirmation.
Source `560327b2b0de5e297488a7634bbf13a338f8a6ea` passed all 12 Apple suites,
macOS and visionOS device/simulator compilation, signed archive/export,
bundle/privacy checks, and matching executable/dSYM checks. The simulator was
compiled, not executed. Identical-name tablet previews were inspected using
the same UI source in the preceding 0.1.1 archive. Physical acceptance of the
new display and current live pen readings remains pending.

The earlier 0.1.1 upload was already underway when matching release numbers
were requested. Its notes/compliance were completed, but 0.2.1 supersedes it.
Retained app artifacts: `artifacts/testflight/0.2.1/build-14/`.
Retained earlier upload: `artifacts/testflight/0.1.1/build-13/`.
Apple accepted 0.2.1 at 2026-09-29T07:40:33Z; final API readback is
**VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING**. Notes and the confirmed Standard / No France
compliance baseline were saved and read back. All GUI signing jobs are unloaded.
IPA SHA-256: `a5a8d2e3174c2bb7f4b0f54d6a255780a5a07ca86cc6f425ccaad48f5eb129d0`.
arm64 dSYM UUID: `A29AEBDA-4FC5-3DCC-B893-4FAD5AC303E4`.
This app delivery is superseded by 0.3.0 above; the host upgrade is pending.

Package `0.2.1~visionos-tablet-setup` is installed on the NanoPi and advertising
as of 2026-09-29T07:43:29Z. The stock extracted-package smoke passed on the
board. Relay identity, headset approvals, tablet metadata, pairing budget and
configuration are byte-identical to the private pre-upgrade backup; the one
tablet Bluetooth bond is retained. The active BlueZ daemon still excludes the
battery plugin. The only package checksum difference is the expected retained
administrator configuration. No ownership reset or tablet removal was run.
All four Ubuntu 26.04 jobs pass: native amd64/arm64 build and package checks,
and clean install/reinstall/removal checks on both architectures. Both native
builds passed 24 relay suites and 101 libsodium tests; lintian passed.
Checksummed packages, provenance and CI logs are retained under
`artifacts/deb/0.2.1~visionos-tablet-setup/`.
[Shared-release package build](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-tablet-relay/actions/runs/36537727000).

## Combined setup — build 12 and package revision 14 (previous delivery)

The operator approved combining initial tablet pairing and headset ownership.
Build 12 and package revision 14 implement a restricted encrypted Noise setup
session, successful tablet verification commits its initiating headset, and the
app goes directly to readings. Tablet removal retains ownership. A retained
headset private key can restore a lost local relay pin through the existing
allowlist; unknown keys cannot take over an owned relay. App-side local forget
and the three-circle UI are removed. SSH ownership reset retains tablet bonds.
See [current enrollment design](docs/bluetooth-tablet-pairing.md). Earlier
three-press descriptions below document prior builds, not the new normal flow.
The user confirmed that they removed the tablet and also used the old local-
forget control. The relay retained one approved headset and no tablets. No
ownership reset was needed or run: the new app can recover with its retained
headset private key, then add the tablet again. Live recovery/enrollment and
pen-position/pressure acceptance remain pending.

App source `d8fc638977706f73c805360e6163481246e078ea` passed all 12 Apple suites
and macOS/visionOS device/simulator SDK builds. The simulator was compiled,
not executed. Empty/replacement tablet pages were inspected in offscreen
previews. Signed archive/export, bundle/privacy and dSYM checks passed.
Apple accepted build 12 at 2026-09-29T07:16:18Z; final API readback is
**VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING** with notes and Standard / No France compliance
saved/read back. All GUI signing jobs are unloaded. Artifacts are retained at
`artifacts/testflight/0.1.0/build-12/`.
IPA SHA-256: `dc232f23095103814b57d0510988371fed6b54a989e49f6c8dcc395bb013f368`.
arm64 dSYM UUID: `678F33A8-D10A-38A3-B3E3-0D0A29E388A1`.
This delivery is superseded by the shared-release work above.

Package source `1f14bd26b995f5188ae9ad421dd085fee7f46e1c` adds only a changelog
line-wrap fix to that implementation. Revision 14 was installed on the NanoPi;
the service was advertising, and the extracted stock-package smoke passed on
that board. Identity, headset approvals, tablet metadata, pairing budget and
live relay configuration are byte-identical to the private pre-upgrade backup.
The active BlueZ daemon still excludes the battery plugin. Only the expected
administrator-modified config differs from the packaged checksums.
All four Ubuntu 26.04 CI jobs pass: native amd64/arm64 builds and fresh
installation/reinstallation/removal checks on both architectures. Both native
builds pass 24 relay suites and 101 libsodium tests; lintian is clean.
Checksummed packages and CI logs are retained under
`artifacts/deb/0.2.0~visionos-tablet-setup.14/`.
[Revision 14 build](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-tablet-relay/actions/runs/36535681897).
The original build passed functional tests but failed lintian on long changelog
lines; the corrected source above was the package installed for that delivery.

## Linux package

The x86-64 host OS is **Ubuntu Server 26.04**. Packages use Ubuntu 26.04 as
the native **amd64 and arm64** build baseline; the current NanoPi hardware
check uses Armbian/Debian 13. Version `0.2.1~visionos-tablet-setup`, source
`560327b2b0de5e297488a7634bbf13a338f8a6ea`, is installed on the NanoPi.
See [package documentation](docs/linux-ble-package.md).

- Revision 11 adds tablet enrollment from the headset app, explicit SSH
  recovery commands, and hostname-based relay discovery.
- Revision 12 sets `GOVERNOR="powersave"` and `ENABLED="true"` in
  `/etc/default/cpufrequtils` on Armbian only. It preserves other settings and
  backs up the original file. Ubuntu Server CPU settings are unaffected.
- Revision 13 packages the required BlueZ battery-plugin exclusion, reloads
  active Bluetooth services during installation/upgrade, and removes its own
  vendor drop-in on uninstall. Manual host preparation is no longer required.
- Automatic Realtek driver-disk switching, offline RTL8851BU Bluetooth firmware,
  Python 3.13 HCI management, and removal cleanup remain included. Firmware
  runs on the radio and is identical for ARM64 and x86-64; the native relay
  library must match the host architecture. USB Wi-Fi is not qualified.

Both native builds pass 24 relay suites, 101 libsodium tests, lintian,
installed-library checks and package checksums. Revision 13's fresh Ubuntu
installation/reinstallation/removal checks also pass on both architectures,
including an Armbian marker fixture to exercise the actual postinst and verify
non-Armbian settings remain unchanged. Revision 11 passed both native and
fresh-install jobs.
[Revision 13 build and artifacts](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-tablet-relay/actions/runs/36524993167).
Artifacts use `artifacts/deb/<software-version>/ubuntu-26.04/{arm64,amd64}/`,
with the Git commit in `source-commit.txt` and `provenance.json`.

### Headless tablet enrollment

Build 8 discovers the relay hostname. For first setup, Add tablet opens a
bounded discovery window, the operator selects a tablet in Bluetooth pairing
mode, and the relay verifies the Wacom vendor, HID service, bond and actual
pen/pad input. Three releases of the same tablet button separately approve
that headset. No tablet model/PID is hardcoded. Saved tablets retain bonds
while offline; Connect differs from new pairing.

Unauthenticated enrollment is limited to an empty relay without saved headset
approvals or an existing/attached tablet. Subsequent tablet management uses the
approved headset's existing Noise connection. A temporary BlueZ agent accepts
only the selected tablet's HID service, never becomes the system default agent,
and cleans up a new bond after failed/canceled enrollment. Ownership, timeouts,
message bounds and crash recovery are covered by tests. Wire message types
48/49 are opt-in; the existing input snapshot and build 7 readings path remain
compatible. Physical acceptance of the new enrollment flow remains pending.

The operator cannot add a hardware button. SSH recovery is explicit:
`sudo plank-tablet-relay-admin reset-headsets --yes` retains the relay identity
and tablet bonds; `remove-tablet AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --yes` removes only the chosen
saved tablet. Recovery was tested with isolated state, not run against live
approvals. No web UI or AP work is implemented.

### NanoPi hardware check

The NanoPi Zero2 on Armbian/Debian 13 with kernel 6.18 recognizes the tested
RTL8851BU Bluetooth 5.3 radio (`3625:010b`). Package automation ejects its
Realtek driver-disk identity (`0bda:1a2b`) and supplies missing firmware before
Bluetooth starts. The board's existing PCIe Wi-Fi remains the network uplink;
USB Wi-Fi is not qualified.

Revision 10 installation was tested after privately backing up the manually
supplied firmware and reproducing a failed Bluetooth probe. The package
supplied fallback links, retried only the failed Bluetooth interface and began
advertising. Repeated preparation preserved the initialized controller.
The user then rebooted the board: driver-disk switching, firmware loading and
advertising completed automatically despite a changed USB bus number. Relay
identity and Wacom bond bytes were unchanged. The tablet's saved bond survives
reboot; an offline saved device does not establish live pen delivery.

Revision 12 upgrades revision 10, preserves the live identity/approvals and
uses the hostname with no explicit name override. The actual service exports
all six data/echo/setup characteristics and advertises successfully. The
package's extracted stock configuration/library smoke test passes on the
board, while the live configuration retains dedicated-adapter mode. The
installer applied the requested Armbian values, retained frequency limits and
boost, and backed up the original configuration. The live governor is
`powersave`. Controller address resolution remains enabled on this radio.

The first live AVP attempt exposed a deployment omission: the earlier host's
manual `--noplugin=battery` override had not been packaged. A captured AVP
connection on the Realtek radio completed the diagnostic exchange, then BlueZ
read Battery Level, received Insufficient Authentication, initiated SMP and
locally disconnected. The same failure was captured on a second connection.
A temporary host override disabled the battery plugin on the NanoPi. Revision
13 then installed the packaged policy; the temporary override was removed, and
the running daemon's actual command line confirms `--noplugin=battery`.
The package's native/extracted smoke checks pass on the NanoPi. Identity and
tablet bonds are retained.

Some later live-readings reconnects still failed. Testing the Intel-specific
controller command returned unsupported-feature status `0x1a` on this Realtek
radio; the option was restored to false. A trace also showed the headset
requesting a previous GATT handle range after relay restarts; possible cache
interaction is not yet a proven cause. No speculative handle-layout or app
transport change was deployed. After installing revision 13, three-press
approval and a saved-key authenticated input observer completed. The operator
reported it working; explicit pen-position/pressure acceptance is still being
confirmed, since the read-only monitor so far showed button/touch reports but
no changing pen axes. Do not equate connection with pen delivery.

Live AVP position/pressure acceptance is requested and remains pending.
A temporary read-only pen monitor is prepared; input-node creation, an active
service or an authenticated connection alone do not count as acceptance.
Physical dongle unplug/replug and new-board sleep/wake qualification also remain
pending. The operator identified the generic “PLANK Tablet Relay” listing as
yesterday's test machine, which was still powered on. Do not hide valid relays
by filtering that name.

A later intermittent timeout occurred when starting readings after approval;
the operator reported that a second attempt worked. A new private radio trace
captured a clean pairing disconnect, followed by link-establishment failures
(`0x3e`) and a connection timeout (`0x08`) before the readings exchange. A later
attempt authenticated successfully. This is evidence of a failed Bluetooth
reconnection, not proof of its underlying cause. The operator subsequently
reported normal operation after restarting their setup. No runtime changes or
new app build were made in response; a proposed bounded startup retry was
deferred. The capture is retained privately for recurrence. Do not claim a
permanent fix or explicit X/Y/pressure acceptance from that report alone.

After a confirmed fresh relay reboot, another attempt failed before the three
approval circles. Boot preparation, firmware, advertising and packaged BlueZ
policy passed; saved relay identity, headset approvals and tablet bond matched
the private backups. The new trace shows successful tablet-setup requests and
replies, followed by a subscription shutdown and a relay-initiated disconnect.
No subsequent authorization connection reached the radio in that failed
attempt. On the same boot with unchanged configuration, the next attempt
completed approval and started authenticated readings at 06:08:58 UTC.

When the nearby Mac became available, an AVP diagnostic archive established
the failed handoff's ordering. The installed app is build 9 and the headset
runs visionOS 27.0.1. The new authorization session attached to the previous
physical link at 06:05:48.571 UTC and was reported ready; about one millisecond
later, visionOS processed the relay's pending disconnect. Service discovery
then failed before an approval request could be sent. The app's earlier local
disconnect callback had not meant the physical link was gone. Both sides'
traces are retained privately. Build 10 below adds bounded recovery for this
specific startup race. It does not establish a cause or complete qualification
for the separate earlier radio `0x3e`/`0x08` failures.

### Qualified Intel host

`plank-tablet-relay-ble` version `0.2.0~visionos-tablet-setup.6`, source
`f23e36b`, targets Ubuntu 26.04 amd64. See
[installation, configuration and hardware guidance](docs/linux-ble-package.md).
Build from a clean committed checkout with `scripts/build-relay-deb.sh` in a
Ubuntu 26.04 builder. It verifies pinned libsodium 1.0.22, runs its tests and
all assertion-enabled relay tests, and collects the package, debug symbols,
build metadata, source commit and SHA-256 manifest.

The service preserves root-owned pairing state, announces readiness only after
GATT/advertising registration, and retries startup failures. A dedicated
adapter policy can power on the controller and clear orphan kernel advertising
instances. That opt-in uses bounded management requests, not the interactive
`btmgmt` shell, which hung with service stdin. A fresh controller has no instance
to remove; attempting unconditional removal was also rejected by the kernel.

The tested host needs both an opt-in controller address-resolution workaround
and a persistent BlueZ override disabling its optional battery plugin. The
package does not silently install that global override on other machines.
Original foreground state has been copied and compared, with the original
retained for rollback. Tablet bonds are unchanged. The controller workaround
is reapplied whenever the managed relay starts.

Revision 5 hardware checks cover managed startup, BlueZ restart, controller power
off/recovery, process crash/recovery, a deliberate orphan advertisement and a
full host reboot. The final package was installed and its files compared to
the package manifest. It advertised automatically five seconds after the new
boot, with no service restarts. The exact relay state and BlueZ tablet bond
file remained unchanged. Persistent BlueZ
policy, limited process capabilities and configuration also survived. Package lifecycle checks preserve identity through upgrade,
remove/reinstall and purge; configuration survives upgrades and is removed
only on purge. Debian Python helpers clean installed bytecode on removal, without renaming
the ctypes library. The build smoke-tests extracted package contents before
collecting artifacts. All 22 relay suites and 101 libsodium tests pass; the
revision 6 binary package has no lintian findings. Ubuntu lintian flags the
private `.changes` file's Debian `experimental` distribution; this package is
installed directly and is not an Ubuntu archive upload.

Package SHA-256:
`83fb4e202224375eef39052cbd96aaecf345e1b306b7594e299070b88d534d82`.
The deliverable and matching symbols/build metadata are retained under ignored
`artifacts/deb/0.2.0~visionos-tablet-setup.6/`.
This is the package retained on the qualified physical host; later revisions
add native ARM packaging and update the build/delivery workflow.

On return, the operator reported “Writing is not permitted.” Echo passed, but
pairing rejected the app's already-approved Client key. This was reproduced
with the installed revision 5 library and an isolated copy of its public
allowlist: a new key reached approval; the existing key failed immediately.
Revision 6 permits full re-approval with fresh physical input and cryptographic
confirmation, retaining the existing entry even on cancellation/failure. Tests
cover a full allowlist, early/invalid confirmation, persistence and subsequent
saved-key authentication. The extracted-package smoke test also exercises a
fragmented request from an existing Client. No app update is required.

Revision 6 is installed, and its package files, state, tablet bond and config
were verified. The operator forgot the direct Wacom pairing on AVP and made
the tablet discoverable. It reconnected to Linux using its existing bond;
no relay-side bond deletion or new tablet enrollment was needed. The journal
then confirmed an existing-headset approval request and authenticated input
observation. User confirmation of displayed position/pressure/button updates
remains pending; do not confuse connection evidence with input acceptance.

## TestFlight build 11

App source `aa12336118445e9035e29ed7fe1dc5c6f700fb92` waits for a nonempty
advertised name before publishing a new relay row. The operator reported that
build 10 briefly showed "Tablet relay" before changing to the hostname; that
was the app's fallback for an advertisement received without LocalName.
There is no added startup timer. A name learned during the current scan is
retained across later nameless advertisements. Expiry, nonconnectable removal,
capacity limits and clearing the list on scan reset remain unchanged. Cached
CoreBluetooth names and saved/offline relays are not used.

All 12 Apple suites pass, including missing/empty/whitespace names, subsequent
name delivery, retained names, current signal, rename, expiry and scan reset.
macOS and visionOS device/simulator SDK builds pass; the simulator was compiled,
not executed. Signed archive/export, bundle/privacy and executable/dSYM checks
pass. The hostname-only startup display still needs physical AVP acceptance.
The build includes build 10's startup connection recovery; no Linux changes.

Apple accepted build 11 at 2026-09-29T06:43:33Z. Exact API readback is
**VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING**; notes and saved Standard / No France compliance
were saved and read back. All GUI signing jobs are unloaded.
Artifacts and provenance are retained under
`artifacts/testflight/0.1.0/build-11/`.
IPA SHA-256: `6b7bf7d80f51ea2ea2653affce1f012738fc909a74d1c87a2b8224ba4efbc89e`.
arm64 dSYM UUID: `14698049-DDE6-3C3F-8523-132164FCD34C`.
This historical build is superseded by the current delivery at the top.

## TestFlight build 10

App source `c2cb8550acd1e76ce88bdcec59f00114048c1d44` recovers once from a
disconnect before the reply subscription is ready. Each attempt owns separate
CoreBluetooth delegates and uses the original 20-second startup deadline.
Cleanup finishes before creating the replacement attempt. This happens before
the caller can send any pairing/authorization/input bytes; established streams
and other errors are not retried. Cancellation prevents the replacement attempt.
Live readings show connection progress. Stage-only logs now use the persisted
notice level without logging identities, keys or tablet input.

All 12 Apple suites pass, including a fake-transport reproduction of the early
disconnect, deadline retention, retry limit, cancellation during cleanup and
no replay after startup. Native macOS and both visionOS SDK builds pass;
the simulator was compiled, not executed. Signed archive/export and bundle,
privacy and executable/dSYM checks pass. After trying build 10, the operator
reported that it seems to fix the connection issue. Repeated cold-start and
specific pen-position/pressure acceptance remain pending.

Apple accepted build 10 at 2026-09-29T06:26:55Z. Exact API readback is
**VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING**; notes and saved Standard / No France compliance
were saved and read back. All GUI signing jobs are unloaded. Artifacts and
provenance are retained under `artifacts/testflight/0.1.0/build-10/`.
IPA SHA-256: `6c1c1a79b287433cd42dd4a14e7960a65bbe905b178a2cf73f18a3c039ff0798`.
arm64 dSYM UUID: `F305AAA7-D1AD-3CA7-9C87-209B07CCB890`.
Build 11 supersedes this app build. Repeat testing after a fresh relay reboot,
through tablet setup, three-press approval and live pen position/pressure.

## TestFlight build 9

Version `0.1.0 (9)`, app source
`b739f2cc81d76b82cc69f772e71518e1f3101351`, shows only relays advertising during
the current foreground scan. Scanning starts when the relay list opens; the
first advertisement is displayed immediately. Repeated advertisements refresh
presence, and an entry expires about five seconds after its last advertisement.
That is a removal grace period, not a startup delay; actual AVP discovery
latency has not been measured. Nonconnectable advertisements are excluded.
Leaving the list or backgrounding the app stops scanning and clears results.

The old saved-relay shortcut and last-relay-name lookup are removed. Current
advertisement names are used instead of CoreBluetooth's cached peripheral name.
Saved Keychain credentials remain available when the relay is rediscovered.
No relay protocol, controller policy or tablet-reading changes are included.
The operator reported build 8 working with revision 13; a specific confirmation
of changing pen X/Y and pressure remains pending.

- Apple 11/11 CTest suites pass, including deterministic discovery refresh,
  expiry, rename, capacity and reset checks.
- Native macOS and visionOS simulator/device SDK builds pass. Simulator was
  compiled, not executed. The relay-page offscreen preview was inspected with
  scanning disabled by its inactive scene environment.
- Signed archive/export, bundle/privacy resources and executable/dSYM matching
  pass. IPA and symbols are retained under ignored
  `artifacts/testflight/0.1.0/build-9/` with previews and provenance.
- IPA SHA-256: `71804bac85102e5583a84b0e84bd84d759343e0457082f147270b59e3e304845`.
- arm64 dSYM UUID: `DF75E104-D169-3F26-9B9A-0D509C7155E1`.

Apple accepted upload at 2026-09-29T05:32:37Z. Processing completed as VALID;
notes and saved compliance were written and read back. The exact build is
**VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING**. All GUI signing jobs are unloaded. The next
upload identifier is recorded with the current delivery at the top. Physical availability-list acceptance remains pending.

## TestFlight build 8

Version `0.1.0 (8)`, app source
`3757f0b00089746193c882759833c61d56132190`, adds headless tablet discovery,
pairing, connection, selection and removal to the headset app. It checks for
the matching relay feature and waits for the management connection to close
before beginning separate three-press headset approval.

Build 7's cleanup remains: obsolete TCP host/port setup, five-key workflow,
Network framework dependency, local-network permission and runtime simulation
are removed. Current `relay-ble-v1:<peripheral UUID>` Keychain accounts and
`client-private-v1` identity remain for secure reconnect. Shared C protocol and
the standalone upstream TCP/raw-HID daemon remain intact. Offscreen previews
are development tools, not an app simulation mode.

- Apple 10/10 CTest suites pass, including tablet management/state checks.
- Native macOS and visionOS simulator/device SDK builds pass with SDK 27.
  Simulator compilation is not simulator execution.
- Signed archive/export, bundle/privacy resources and executable/dSYM matching
  pass. Tablet scan and saved-tablet layouts were inspected in offscreen previews.
- IPA SHA-256: `c26206e4fcaa0a9759603e5d7e602fbf4eda6b6005dc474560529f6731256099`.
- arm64 dSYM UUID: `A73F6E33-E768-34E4-9505-DFDA97BB89A5`.
- IPA, symbols, previews and provenance are retained under ignored
  `artifacts/testflight/0.1.0/build-8/`.

Apple accepted upload at 2026-09-29T04:56:55Z. The exact build is
**VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING**; notes and the saved compliance baseline were
written and read back. GUI archive/export/upload jobs are unloaded. Build 9 supersedes this app
release. Physical pen-position/pressure acceptance remains pending.

## Established hardware findings

The operator confirmed pen position, pressure and ExpressKeys all update on
AVP through the foreground relay in build 4. The same Intel 7265 radio passed
Bumble and BlueZ echo tests. A controlled BlueZ comparison passed with controller
LE address resolution off, failed with it on, and passed again with it off.
A second disconnect during authorization was caused by BlueZ's battery GATT
client: its authenticated battery read provoked SMP and local disconnection.
Disabling that optional plugin allowed three-press enrollment and saved-key
Noise reconnect. See [Bluetooth protocol and investigation](docs/bluetooth-headset-lab.md).

The tested radio is Bluetooth 4.2. New hardware guidance is Bluetooth 5.0 or
newer, BR/EDR plus BLE, Linux firmware support, peripheral advertising and
verified concurrent tablet/headset operation. Bluetooth 4.0 is not qualified;
a version label alone does not establish the required roles or reliability.

The Linux tablet bond previously survived a full host reboot, and physical
input plus tablet-initiated sleep/wake reconnection were observed without new
pairing. The apparent short disconnect was not timed from the final input;
do not claim a measured 15-minute idle cutoff. See
[headless tablet pairing](docs/bluetooth-tablet-pairing.md).

Build 5's direct-tablet experiment found no usable app input despite the
operator confirming the tablet awake and Connected in visionOS Settings.
No Wacom appeared in its BLE scan, and the input readout had no pointer/stylus
or events. This does not disprove every possible direct API; it establishes no
public raw-report path for the tested approach. A Linux decoder alone cannot
supply a missing transport. Build 5 source remains at `606d5bd` in Git history.

## Pairing and delivery contracts

Three short releases of the same supported tablet button approve one pending
request within 60 seconds. No model/PID allowlist, readiness checkbox or manual
SSH signal is used on the BLE path. Holds, mixed buttons, detach and cancellation
cannot carry partial approval into another request. This convenience scheme
retains the documented nearby-attacker risk during initial enrollment; it is
not equivalent to a random authentication challenge. Subsequent sessions use
the saved-key Noise connection and encrypted readings. Since 0.6.2 the test observer preserves every complete
evdev report; the earlier 20Hz coalescing limit was removed.
The 80-byte snapshot wire format and reserved bytes remain unchanged.

The operator authorized future build-specific TestFlight notes and compliance
completion with saved answers "Standard and No France". The verified API
baseline is `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`; reuse it only while encryption
and distribution are unchanged. Crypto still includes CPace/Noise/libsodium.
Use `scripts/update-tablet-testflight.py` for exact version/build selection,
bounded processing waits and readback. Signing uses the authorized GUI session;
never reset Keychain permissions or copy credentials into Git.
